0,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).If ""Return of the King"" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.Go see it."
1,"Nov 26, 2021",10,"This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own."
2,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.I laughed, lots. I cried, lots. I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots I even punched the air in a ""go on!"" during one sceneI can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.Go with it. Enjoy the ride.Soak up every second, it doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.I have nothing else to say.10/10. Well done Russo brothers. Well done!Fans! Assemble!"
3,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Thank you Marvel, End Game is an ending that give me speechless."
4,"May 8, 2019",10,"After watching Infinity war, I was looking forward to much more this time, still a perfect ending."
5,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews. Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie."
6,"Sep 25, 2021",10,As always avengers didn't disappoint even with a few loops or inconsistencies. Hope marvel does more movies about some characters from avengers.
7,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
8,"Apr 30, 2019",6,After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story. I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War. I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story. There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others. The story is average at best with big flaws.
9,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.
10,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!"
11,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies. I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!"
12,"Apr 29, 2019",8,"The Russo Brothers will be forever known as the directors that failed a franchise and insulted the very fans that embraced it.I have no idea why they felt their finished product would pay homage to Stan Lee's legacy or the characters he brought to life but this ""closure"" to a decade of greatness was, in fact, the most disappointing 3-hours of character assassination in cinematic history."
13,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I loved how the story of the Infinity War was conceived. With all the fight scenes and the emotional aspect of the movie, especially the end part, everything was superb. But this is supposed to be a wrap-up film. The directors and writers just destroyed it all. What's the point of doing a hype over Captain Marvel for this movie when you just give her a few minutes of screen time? It would be forgiven if you give her an amazing fight with the villain during the climax. But what have you done? With just a few kicks and punches and that's it. It doesn't give a scratch over Thano's face. What a crap!!!You also ruin Hulk! He is supposed to be the strongest Avenger after the events of Infinity War, after all the disappointment and frustration he has experienced when Hulk won't face Thanos. But this time, he's just as good as nothing Avenger. I wonder why they did not give Thanos and Hulk a fight of a lifetime. I'm really surprised that they did not even get face-to-face when all hell breaks loose.This movie is dubbed as an action movie but got 75% of the time talking and mumbling.There's no justice at all to those beloved characters and this movie. You have ruined my expectations."
14,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but would I watch it a second time? Probably not - until the DVD comes out.I've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.That being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.It's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.The fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.All in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me."
15,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Rating 10/10 Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie. Go see it you wont regret it !! Perfection Marvel Endgame !!
16,"Apr 30, 2019",8,I went in with the highest expectations and came out underwhelmed and disappointed. its nowhere near as good as infinity war !!!
17,"Apr 24, 2019",10,This movie proves the Russo brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to closing a franchise this big. In my opinion they pulled of the most satisfying ending this story arc could have.It's nothing without its previous 21 movies. Must watch for every movie fan.
18,"May 12, 2019",9,"Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point. In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements... The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on. Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out."
19,"Jun 14, 2019",6,This movie was a terrible mess from start to finish.
20,"May 4, 2019",10,Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...
21,"Aug 19, 2019",8,3 hours out of my life I will never get back. not worth the hype. you think the soap opera is done by the ultimate battle. think again. let us milk it and release another spider man. geez a lou.
22,"Apr 26, 2019",8,Absolutely strange how they could cut so strong first part of Avengers and spoil the second one! All dialogues are weak and absurd same as a few plot lines. The last 5 minutes of the film is all-around failure!
23,"Sep 2, 2019",9,"The dumbing down of Hulk and ruining his character by turning him into an utter wimp, turning Thor into a bumbling drunkard, really? Well done Disney on ruining yet another couple of hero's characters (See Luke Skywalker and Yoda in Disney's Last Jedi for extra confirmation of this) That's all I've got to say about this movie."
24,"Nov 4, 2019",10,"Avengers Endgame is the culmination of 11 years of movies, in this vast universe of comics, as a fan since the first iron man movie, which hooked, I thought that the Winter Soldier was the best Marvel movie, but Infinity War and Endgame made me To think twice, this movie is something truly epic, I had not seen something like this since the Lord of the Rings: the return of the king, and even that has plot holes, and that he makes the same mistakes as his predecessor Infinity war brothers Russo did an incredible job together with the whole cast, it's one of those movies to watch before he dies, this movie does put an ""End"" on this Infinity Saga."
25,"May 15, 2019",2,"I watch all films with an open mind and went into this 3 hour long film without any preconceptions.This film really let itself down. The writers completely changed some of the characters, they tried to make it funny and failed at every attempt where it was cringe worthy and boring. The story was dragged out to its limit and went on for way to long.Don't waste your money at the cinema, maybe Google the outcome."
26,"Mar 25, 2021",10,The Most Overrated Movie Of All Time. (Will Always be the Most Overrated and most Forgettable Movie Of all Time.)
27,"Aug 30, 2024",9,"The sheer scale of Endgame is both its greatest strength and its most significant weakness. On one hand, the film is an epic, three-hour-long spectacle that offers a rollercoaster of emotions-grief, hope, nostalgia, and triumph. The final battle scene, where all the heroes unite against Thanos, is a jaw-dropping, cheer-inducing moment that's destined to be iconic. The visual effects are top-notch, and the action sequences are choreographed with meticulous precision.On the other hand, the movie's scale can make it feel bloated and unwieldy. With so many characters and storylines to juggle, not all of them get the attention they deserve. Some heroes, like Captain Marvel, are underutilized, while others, like Thor, receive arcs that are divisive among fans. Thor's transformation into a depressed, beer-guzzling shadow of his former self is played for laughs but also feels like a disservice to his character development in previous films.The time-travel plot is another area where Endgame falters. While it allows for some fantastic callbacks to earlier films and provides a clever way to undo the events of Infinity War, it also introduces a host of logical inconsistencies. The film's explanation of time travel is murky at best, and the rules seem to change whenever it's convenient for the plot. This lack of clarity can be frustrating, especially for viewers who prefer a more coherent narrative structure."
28,"Oct 29, 2024",10,"This movie feels more like a culmination of all the Marvel movies. A perfect closing to the MCU uptil that point. It brings back all the major characters and settings throughout the whole Marvel franchise. Talking about the movie after almost 5 years even today I get goosebumps. It marks the end of a few main characters that will literally drive any Marvel fan to tears. The plot revisits a few great Marvel moments from earlier movies literally bringing in a wave of nostalgia. The film has remarkable action, splendid visual effect, moving musical score and an even greater emotional weight. Kudos to the actors, directors, writers and the whole team for making such an awesome movie that has left a profound impact on our generation. This movie will always remain special to me."
29,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Basically the title. Left me speechless. I was probably too hyped to the point of annoyance but it broke my massive expectations to the point that I'm watching it again 2 more times this weekend. It leaves you at the edge of your seat and the 3rd act is just insane and a masterpiece. Infinity War was fantastic but this is insanity, in all the right ways. The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some."
30,"Mar 10, 2022",10,THE STORY IS VERY WELL BUILT THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CHARACTERS IS GREATCGI IS GOODTHE PERFORMANCE IS GOODIT WAS A GREAT LAST CHAPTER AFTER THIS FILMuDIDN'T WATCH ANYTHING ABOUT MARVEL BECAUSE NOW IT JUST MAKES GARBAGE.
31,"May 1, 2019",6,Problem with time travel is if your not careful you make the whole plot impossible to believe. End game doesn't even come close to tieing up its loose ends. The remaining avengers act selfishly and arragently to the point you want them to fail.Thanos did nothing wrong. I hated this film.
32,"Jun 20, 2019",10,Wow... All i can say is that the movie ended my entire childhood in the most perfect way!! It kept you on your feet the whole way through!! Marvel somehow manages to add comedy to the most intense situations. its Awesome!! The battle scene was out of this world!! I just... wow.. Thank you marvel. I love you 3000!!! ROBERT DOWN JUNIOR WON THE HERO OF THE YEAR AWARD THIS YEAR LAST WEEK AT THE MTV MOVIE AND TV AWARDS!!
33,"Feb 9, 2020",8,"This Is Not A Movie,Not Cinema, This Is A Theme Park"
34,"Dec 23, 2021",10,One of the best superhero movies I have ever watched.All the actors really nailed their roles.Especially my one and only favorite iron man.Robert Downey Jr is irreplaceable in Iron man role.
35,"May 5, 2019",8,"It's a long film at 3 hours the last one being better because this concludes the 10 year story in at great and satisfying way. The first 2 hours are build up that is ultimately paid off but I felt the middle dragged on I just wanted to get to the end. Infinity war kept me interested the whole time, more than endgame. It's definitely worth the whatch and after you don't have to worry about spoilers.8/10."
36,"Nov 3, 2019",10,"Don't listen to the haters, it's amazing! Seriously, this is the movie of the year!"
37,"May 4, 2019",6,"Honestly felt like a completely different film from Avengers Infinity War. In fact the film had such a different tone from all the Marvel films before.The characters changed, the story line was poor. Incredibly disappointing end to phase three"
38,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"No words...absolutely incredible, THE best way to end the whole series. Watching all the movies to finish with this, every single hour was worth it, hats off to Marvel 👏🏽"
39,"Apr 28, 2019",2,"Too many cringe worthy moments. Too much talking not enough action. This is superhero movie, not looking for bloodly oscar performance. Time travel thing was silly nonsense. I felt like walking out."
40,"May 4, 2019",8,"This is my own opinion, but so many things that didn't make sense in that movie... like so much stuff that could've been utilised in a better way and so many stupid things that were put on wrong hands. The image and the graphics are really good but the plot is weak. Emotionally I give a 9/10 Graphics I give a 9/10 Storyline I give a 3/10"
41,"Aug 2, 2019",10,They've really scrapped the bottom with this one! Oh so Bad!
42,"Jul 16, 2019",9,great performancesincredible visualsstory ends in a way to set worth a new generation of marvel stories/charactersperfect send off for the original actorsa must see for any marvel or superhero fan
43,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"The best marvel movie ever, I cannot put into words how amazing this movie was, too good!"
44,"Oct 9, 2019",10,"Let me start by saying THIS is how you wrap a saga!!!! I loved this movie, it was an emotional rollercoaster from open to close, and a fitting way to pay tribute to the legend of Stan Lee."
45,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame is the final film to the Infinity saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story is emotional, unpredictable, unforgettable, complex and intense. The story does continue on right after infinity war had finsihed, and I thought it was a good way too start because the characters can give you an understanding of how they are feeling. How much loss they have witnessed. During the three hour film, you care so much for the characters that it makes you want them to live through the whole time, leaving with no casualties. The acting by the cast is outstanding, none of their lines sounded cheesy. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr especially. The audience has never seen the two characters shine so bright and powerful over the last 11 years. The visuals are the most impressive, it is shown to be Oscar worthy and you would be hungry for more as the film continues on. The final battle was the bomb, the mother of all battles, better then Ready Player One's finale. It's so big and all of it fits in perfectly. Avengers Endgame is the perfect finale that has been set up over the last 11 years. Its a rewatchable film and you will never see the characters the same way as you have seen them from the past films."
46,"Sep 4, 2024",9,"FILM: 8.5 Rewatching Avengers: Endgame, I'm struck by how well the Russo Brothers pull off the enormous task of giving each character their due. This film had a lot riding on it, and I still find it incredibly well-made, immensely enjoyable, and ultimately satisfying. The drama is especially well done here-Marvel finally nails it after a string of more digestible, lighter stories. The weight of the stakes is felt throughout, and it's a welcome change.The drama is where this film really shines for me. After several years of Marvel playing it safe with more easily digestible stories, Endgame takes a much-needed dive into heavier emotional territory. It's clear that Marvel finally got it right, delivering drama that feels earned and impactful. Downey Jr, Evans, and Renner are the standout beneficiaries of this approach, with the film both opening and closing with some of their best moments. Their performances anchor the story, making it feel grounded even amidst all the superhero spectacle.The action is, as expected, top-notch, but what surprises me is the level of violence-there's a bit more edge here than I'm used to seeing in a Marvel film. It's refreshing to see some real variation and consequence in the battles, something Marvel has tried to smooth over a bit too much in the past. Watching these characters face real stakes is immensely rewarding, and it adds a layer of intensity that makes the film all the more compelling.Comedy still has its place in Endgame, providing much-needed relief from the drama-heavy narrative. Thor and Rocket handle most of the humour, and while I enjoy their banter, I do feel that Thor's storyline pushes the comedy a bit too far. It sometimes feels like it's making light of what should be serious moments, which can be a bit jarring.After 11 years, Marvel truly delivered a fitting end to this saga. Seeing how successful it was, and how the franchise has failed to reach similar heights over the past five years, is a testament to just how well they wrapped things up.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0 Upscaled 2160/24p presentation Detail level: Good Colour reproduction: Good Level accuracy: Excellent Encode: Excellent Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 9.0 Dolby Atmos audio Dialogue reproduction: Excellent Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent Dynamics: Good Surround sound presentation: Excellent LFE content: GoodMOOFIEMETER: 9.0."
47,"Jun 14, 2019",7,I don't really know what all the hype is about. Bored watching this as it's the same again just rehashed. Glad to see the back of the Avengers to be honest.
48,"Jun 15, 2019",2,I was not impressed. Save your money and time. Wait till they show this in Netflix John Wick 3 should have been in this film and story line could have been way better!
49,"May 17, 2019",10,"Hello again everyone! It's been almost a month since thousands of Marvel fans (including myself) got to see the one and only Endgame for the very first time, without having a clue of what could possibly happen. And as with most of the people who already watched it...there are no words to describe how this amazingly crafted piece of superhero movie-making just...blew me away.I will start by giving its credit to the acting work of everyone. When we appreciate that, we can see that this isn't just another sci-fi flick where no one does exactly a great effort to make a remarkable performance. No. This is a movie that presents us a group of heroes that, after long years of saving the earth from any menace, are giving the last of themselves in order to give the planet one last shot. The performances made it all seem authentic and real.Now, the story. God. The story is many things. Sometimes it's funny, as any other of the previous movies from the MCU. But also it's deep, melancholic, tragic, and most of all, undeniably exciting.10/10. Probably most of the people that will read this had already watched it. But in case you haven't, you really, REALLY ought to do so. Probably during quite a few years, there will be no other film of the genre that can possibly make you feel all of the emotions that Avengers Endgame made the audiences feel, and made me feel. Don't miss it for anythingPeace!"
50,"Oct 23, 2024",10,"This movie is simply brilliant! The Ending is sad but a necessary Chancg for marvel. The New movies are mstly just trash! It is very sad to see such a great studio die. This masterpiece was a loveletter to All Fans. Its even for non-fans a must watch movie all the new multiverse trash is just marvels try to get the last cents out of the viewers pockets. Its very sad to see how disney and their greed ruined the entire franchise. So have fun enjoying this last masterpiece by marvel Studios. I personally love the Endingen, but i can unverstanden everyone, who disagrees with me!I think disney killed marvel and star wars!"
51,"Nov 20, 2023",9,"This films quality depends on how you watched it and who you are. If you watched most of the MCU up to this point like I did then this will be a revolutionary endgame that redefines all of film culture. Otherwise it seems rather bad and underwhelming. The film has a forward moving plot, great acting and some CGI actually worth looking at. This film didn't become the highest grossing movie of all time for no reason. It does have some obvious flaws tropes and plot holes but other than that acts as a brilliant finale to the infinity saga. Now don't watch the multiverse saga. It willn't ruin your opinion but they aren't good sequels either. All in all a film worth watching if you have watched the entire MCU up to that point, otherwise an okay film. And watch infinity war before you watch this, otherwise literally nothing will make sense."
52,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Just watch this epic final of the best Marvel movie ever!
53,"May 2, 2019",8,I was super excited to see this movie after Infinity War ended but I left rather disappointed. It was good but I felt like the first hour or so was wasted space. I did love Thor though.
54,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Despite what others may say or have said this film was far from predictable. I certainly lost my bets. I both laughed and cried during this film. I loved every minute and none of those minutes were wasted. The writers outdid themselves on this one. I just hope the next ten years can live up to the first. Here's hoping.
55,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Just watched the new Avengers-movie. It's simply fantastic and a must-watch for every Marvel-Fan. It contains everything I expected and wished for an so much more. It's hard to put in words without a spoiler. Find out by yourself and enjoy.
56,"Apr 26, 2019",7,"...and pull the hype train over. Amazing fun, stunning spectacle great performances especially RDJ. It's just not the whole sum of its parts. Lots of great parts but not cohesively held. Too much Comedy with one character essentially now just full comedy relief. The most ridiculous coincidences and a couple of plot holes. You will laugh, you will get gut punched and for some you will cry, but then you will wonder what really happened in that 3 hours. Did it need 3 hours? No. Is it better than infinity war? No. Will you enjoy it? Definitely."
57,"Sep 4, 2019",10,"Wow. This film will have you going through every emotion imaginable. If you have followed every Marvel movie in sequence leading up to this conclusion, you will soon be left feeling like you have lost a family member. An amazing end to this Marvel chapter."
58,"Sep 10, 2024",10,"I don't have words to express my love for this and infinity war!I agree that infinity war was much better than this, but I think some of the ""serious"" or ""boring"" moments in this movie was needed to explore the consequences of The Blip.Anyway, even as a standalone movie, it's too good: A group of superheros go back in time to undo the actions of a mad titan.Moreover, as a movie that is linked to multiple other movies and serves as a conclusion, it's one of the best things that's happened to cinema! It's the best in every aspect. It's emotionally intense and visually rich.It's almost guaranteed that you're gonna get goosebumps in the climax!Infinity War and Endgame are one of the best movies of all time and you can't miss them!I'd highly recommend you to start watching The MCU from Iron Man and you're gonna fall in love with the two movies mentioned above.If you ain't very familiar with MCU, don't watch. It'll leave you being confused and you'll end up disliking it."
59,"Aug 6, 2023",10,"I just watched the Avengers movies and some of the infinity saga and I truly think this is a great movie, the CGI and acting were wonderful and the ending was truly a masterpiece and was probably the best ending for a movie saga (don't quote me on this). There are some low points but they are they don't effect the true rating which is a ten, this movie deservers the 8.4. Or an 8.5, I kinda have a bias. Cause i grew up with the marvel movies specifically Iron Man and stuff but the bias does not effect my rating. I live it and many others love it as well i regard this the end 0of the entire mcu from Iron Man - No Way Home, the other multiverse movies are mid and are very odd."

61,"Jan 9, 2020",10,"Avengers: Endgame is quite possibly the most hyped up movie of all time. The excitement surrounding this films release is a dream come true for Marvel Studios and Disney. With that being said, I have looked forward to this film since it was called Infinity War Part 2 back in 2015 or so. I really enjoyed my time watching this and it marked the end of an era. I finally realized a couple years ago how much the MCU means to me and how much these characters mean to me that I gladly would accept anything this movie did.The CGI was good, but the green screen showed a little bit (meaning the backgrounds looked fake sometimes), the performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans were great because they treated this movie seriously, the cameos in here felt welcomed and the amount of locations in this movie really make it feel like the Avengers are desperate to go anywhere and do anything to save their fallen friends. With all this being said this is a very well made movie worth your time and money."
62,"Aug 6, 2019",7,"I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess."
63,"Dec 2, 2019",10,They are unhappy. Instead of movies bringing joy in their lives they just want their life problems spill over to others. Don't fall for it. This is a good movie.
64,"May 6, 2019",6,"Enjoyable movie that takes to long to get into the action and doesn't make any sense once you step back and think about what they've done. Even their explanations on what they were going to do, what they did do, and the final outcomes make no sense. I believe the world would be an even bigger mess when they were done, and Steve broke all the rules!"
65,"Sep 20, 2023",10,"""Avengers: Endgame"" - A Spectacular Culmination of Marvel's Cinematic UniverseIn the realm of superhero cinema, ""Avengers: Endgame"" stands as an unprecedented achievement. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, this epic finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) represents the culmination of over a decade of storytelling and character development. Clocking in at just over three hours, ""Endgame"" is a sprawling, emotionally charged spectacle that delivers on its promise to provide closure for beloved characters while reshaping the MCU's future.The film begins in the aftermath of ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" with half of all life in the universe obliterated by the malevolent Thanos (Josh Brolin). The surviving Avengers are left reeling, grappling with guilt and loss. The emotional weight of this situation is palpable, setting a somber tone that lingers throughout the movie.One of the film's strengths lies in its character-driven narrative. Each Avenger is given ample screen time to grapple with the consequences of their actions and confront their own vulnerabilities. Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a standout performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man, showcasing his character's evolution from a self-centered genius to a selfless hero. Similarly, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow bring depth and gravitas to their roles.""Endgame"" also skillfully employs humor to offset its darker moments. The banter between characters provides much-needed levity, ensuring the film remains entertaining even during its most emotionally charged sequences. This balance of humor and pathos has been a hallmark of the MCU and is executed with finesse here.One of the film's most impressive feats is its ability to seamlessly weave together multiple storylines and characters. The time-travel aspect of the plot allows the Avengers to revisit key moments from previous films, resulting in a nostalgic and satisfying trip down memory lane for fans. It's a testament to the filmmakers' dedication to honoring the MCU's history while moving the narrative forward.The action sequences in ""Endgame"" are nothing short of spectacular. The climactic battle in the third act is a visual feast, featuring a jaw-dropping array of heroes, powers, and epic showdowns. It's a triumphant moment that pays off years of anticipation and buildup. The Russo brothers' direction, combined with Alan Silvestri's stirring score, elevates these sequences to a cinematic crescendo.As for the film's antagonist, Thanos remains a formidable and complex foe. Brolin's motion-capture performance adds depth to the character, and his motivations, while morally questionable, are presented with a degree of philosophical nuance. Thanos remains one of the MCU's most compelling villains.However, ""Endgame"" is not without its criticisms. Some viewers may find the film's lengthy runtime a bit daunting, and certain plot elements involving time travel could be seen as overly convoluted. Additionally, a few character arcs, while emotionally satisfying, may leave fans divided.In conclusion, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a monumental achievement in the world of superhero cinema. It successfully pays tribute to the characters and stories that have captivated audiences for years while charting a bold new course for the MCU. With its powerful performances, humor, and breathtaking action sequences, it's a fitting and emotional conclusion to an era of cinematic storytelling. While it may not be without its minor flaws, ""Endgame"" stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of the superhero genre and will likely be remembered as a cinematic milestone for years to come."
66,"Jan 10, 2020",10,"⭐ 10/10 RDJ u r awesome. Great performance by director, cinematographer. Actions is excellent. Dialogues are extremely good."
67,"Jan 7, 2020",10,"Let's talk about the enormity of this film and what Marvel just accomplished.First, this movie did not disappoint. It is very hard to contemplate a movie that will ever have as much or more anticipation than Endgame. Just think about the build up of this film. From May 2008 to April 2019, Marvel, in 21 films, introduced heroes, villains, plots, side plots, family members, love interests and countless Easter eggs that culminated into this film.Second, in a movie full with 10+ main characters, Marvel did an unbelievable job featuring each one and staying true to the characters we've all fallen in love with. This point could easily be a thesis paper for a doctoral candidate. The development and story arcs of characters, individually and collectively, in the midst of struggle and triumph is nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail and thoughtful craftsmanship is true artwork. One knock fans may have is the forced fandom moments. We have so many beloved characters but these moments comes as certain team-up pairings during the big fight that are great but also forced and stereotypical.Lastly, this movie is beauty in motion. Mainly, the movie looks and sounds wonderful. If there is one knock against the movie, the final fight at points was too dark for some of the characters. Otherwise, the final fight displays exactly what many of the DC movies have failed with, Hero power display. Marvel did such a great job of making you feel every punch, kick, hammer throw but also made you feel like you were in motion with each character (thus why I believe 4D would be very good). The sound editing is very good and the song selections in this movie help the viewers follow the emotional roller-coaster ride everyone believes they are in for.Marvel created near perfection for fans (or a near perfect ending). And the ending of this movie, isn't even technically the finish to Phase 3 of their universe. That would be Spider-man: Homecoming coming soon. Phase 4 and 5 are also already in the works. Everyone that was a part of this movie and the first 3 phases should be applauded, but their work is not yet done because for those with the greatest power comes great responsibility."
68,"Nov 5, 2019",10,Avengers endgame is one of a kind well done Marvel studios
69,"Nov 14, 2021",9,"It's definitely not as strong an impression as it was on first viewing, which makes perfect sense, but I still think the film was extremely successful on multiple levels. One of the better things is that the three-hour film is not boring at any point, it seemed to me to last ""only"" two hours, which is not easy to achieve. I also look at this film as the finale or the last episode of a series you've been watching for years, which on the one hand is actually true. So much has happened before this film, so many characters and events. This film is just the crown of it all, one big rounded whole. It is obvious that the Russo brothers had a plan because it is obvious that they paid attention to details and some smaller moments that real fans will easily recognize. Of course I have some objections that are related to certain characters and some scenes, but given the type of film and how much the film offers, I can just get over it and forget about it. I think this Marvel project is unrepeatable and it's something we should appreciate no matter what you think of movies like this."
70,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"This movie is so full of cliches, it is so unoriginal and filled with stale humour that you just shouldn't do something as bad as watching this to yourself."
71,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"The 22-movie Infinity Saga of the MCU comes to a close in its best film yet. Avengers: Endgame is everything we wanted and more. It's hilarious, it's action-packed, and has one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a superhero film, let alone any movie. It's full of fan service and nods to the previous films. I don't really have any issues with the film, at least those that are not spoilers anyway. If I had one non-spoiler issue with the film it would be fact that the first hour is a bit slow but afterwards it picks up and never stops. Really any complaints I have with this film is shut out by everything else. My complaints are just nitpicks. It fits its three hour runtime very well and provides a highly satisfying end to the 11 year saga that began with Iron Man in 2008. The MCU has set a new direction and I can't wait to see what happens next."
72,"Nov 3, 2019",10,Great movie i almost cried and great ending to the series of movies
73,"May 2, 2019",10,"It's every marvel fans dream come to reality, people can nip pick the time travel but that's not really a flaw because they done it right by giving the fans what they want, the movie has lot of fan services but it never hurts the plot it actually helps it and it shows how much the russo brothers cared about this universe, by time the movie ends you feel like a life time has past, the end of an era."
74,"Mar 21, 2021",10,Not a good film. Took me a few watches to realize.
75,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"The climax that all fans deserve. Marvel still pulls out surprises that you couldn't dream of, allowing this to earn a spot anongst some of the greatest films made. The length yields an utterly satisfying scene, but honours the 11 years of the studio with the perfect ending."
76,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"Honestly: at the 2 hour mark i was checking my watch to try and figure out how much more I had to put up with before it made sense. The storyline was sporadic, and bounced around so much that it just got confusing and boring. I have no intent, nor interest, to watch it again"
77,"Jun 14, 2024",9,"This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up.

I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own."
78,"Oct 16, 2019",9,"Endgame is certainly one of its kind. A movie that will be marked as the film of this decade. Building up from Iron Man to Captain Marvel, a 10 journey filled with joy, adventure and tears. And we need a perfect ending to all of that. Endgame is the perfect ending. A movie that has everything a fan will ever dream of, an amazing cast and a wonderful climax. It is such a huge payoff from 10 years worth of building up. To look at this from a Fan's perspective, it is an awesome movie and it is a masterpiece. But to look at this from a critic's perspective, it is not the best movie. It certainly lacks some elements to a perfect movie. But this to me, is such a wonderful movie and I definitely loved it. It has everything I wanted and I'm gonna give this movie a 9/10."
79,"Apr 29, 2024",10,"Just over 5 years ago, the culmination of the first 3 phases of The MCU came to a head with Avengers: Endgame. This was one of the biggest Cinematic events to ever take place and with it hitting its 5 year anniversary, I thought I would give it a rewatch and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees the world in turmoil after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, with one last chance to make things right, The Avengers reunite to take on their biggest challenge.Main Character Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark was the real start of this whole cinematic universe and he is brilliant in this film. He really delivers a strong performance, you see how the events of the previous film really affects him and motivates him to come to terms and once again become Iron man. He still has the funny quips and narcissism that made his character famous which is great.Chris Evans is back as Steve Rogers and similarly he does a great job with this iconic role. He has great chemistry with Downey & Scarlett Johansson and I thought this film did a great job putting him back in the spotlight and having him being an emotional centre of the film.Supporting Characters Now this might be the largest cast in film history, so I will definitely miss some people out but everybody delivers on their performances and really bring the comic book characters to the cinema screen.Mark Ruffalo reprises his role as Bruce Banner and I actually liked the direction they take his character in this film. They make him a more enjoyable character to watch and it is really good seeing The Hulk getting a bit more time to shine after missing for the majority of the previous film.Scarlett Johansson plays Natasha Romanoff and they really did some really good work with her character of Black Widow. She really struggles with the weight that comes with being one of the leaders of The Avengers who failed and Johansson is strong in her role here.Chris Hemsworth is back as Thor and after the events of Infinity War he is really the character that is effected in a really interesting way. The film handles his failures in a way that I don't think anyone could have expected and it is handled well with Thor developing a lot during the film.After missing Infinity War, Jeremy Renner & Paul Rudd are back as Clint Barton & Scott Lang respectively. The film really focuses on the issues that Barton has gone through since the events of the previous film and it is pretty dark and easy to relate too. Paul Rudd is mostly used for comic relief but is a lot of fun and when he needs to deliver some more dramatic scenes he is good at that too.Don Cheadle gets more screen time as Rhodey and does a good job, Karen Gillan is given her best work yet as Nebula and Thanos played by Josh Brolin is a great villain, though he is clearly not the most important character like he was in Infinity War.Story The story is great, it really fits the drama and feeling of a world in disarray after what happened in the previous film and the performances delivered on it. Despite having lots of characters and lots of story beats to hit, it really delivers on it and has twists and turns that wouldn't be expected and really drive it up. There is plenty of comic book film fun though and the last act of the film is pure cinema and an experience unlike any other, especially for fans of these films that have been watching since the beginning.Script This film actually feels a little different to others in the MCU in that it is more serious. It realises the situation that the characters are in and realises it has to be a bit more serious and have these characters have emotional issues and I am glad they went in this direction. The film does have plenty of humour though and these people are naturally funny which does help.Style The film has great action sequences, there is a lot of green screen and CGI but it looks great throughout and the way they managed to make the film seem really epic is through this. The film is 3 hours long but it really doesn't feel like it, it is paced really well and allows the audience to be invested in the story.Overall Overall, Avengers: Endgame is one of my favourite films. Being a huge fan of Marvel, this felt like the apex of what could be achieved and the fact that everybody involved nailed it so well made it a truly special event and one that needs to be seen.Rating - 10/10."
80,"May 22, 2019",10,A perfect way to end the avengers saga. This movie will have you feeling all your emotions. Totally worth the 10 years of movies and the 3 hour play screen
81,"Jun 22, 2019",8,"Loved Endgame but with a lukewarm feeling for The Eternals and Shang Chi on the horizon, I wondered whether the MCU should make more logical choices for the next phase. Obviously there are development issues with the FF and X-Men franchises and DC's Aquaman may well scupper a potential Sub-Mariner movie, but perhaps these would work:1) Captain Britain (we heard 'Braddock' mentioned by Peggy Carter in Endgame; Brian's father perhaps?) 2) Alpha Flight. With the Avengers having run their course, perhaps their Canadian counterparts could step up. It stands to reason that other countries would want to copy the Avengers model (I know they are the Earth's protectors but they pretty much belong to the USA). 3) Moon Knight. Although I would love to see Daredevil done right on the big screen, maybe Marc Spector could fill the void. 4) Silver Surfer. Norrin Radd was the best thing about the FF sequel. A space-based movie would give him room to soar. Look to GotG or the Ron Lim Thanos issues of Silver Surfer for inspiration. 5) Ka-Zar. Although often perceived as a Tarzan rip-off, Lord Kevin Plunder's exploits could open up a whole new playground with the Savage Land.I wonder if we'll look back in 10 years and see if any of these came to pass...!"
82,"Apr 29, 2019",6,Lazy plotline used(timetravel) a good climax but the rest was pretty boring. Only people who love the mcu would think this is an above average movie.
83,"May 1, 2019",8,"I'm a huge fan of long slow-crawl movies (cue LOTR trilogy) but the first half of this culminating slog was way too slow and artificially melodramatic. This is in stark contrast to Infinity War's well edited, if not somewhat fractured fast paced scenes.If anything Infinity War could of used an extra 20min of dialogue and slower pacing edited out of Endgame. In the end, still a fun movie but not without obvious pacing flaws."
84,"Apr 26, 2019",10,You literally should watch every other movie before this.
85,"Nov 16, 2024",8,"Avengers: Endgame was an experience that transcended mere movie-watching for me; it felt like a grand event, a culmination of over a decade of storytelling that I had been a part of. Walking into the theater, the atmosphere was electric, with fans buzzing with anticipation, some even dressed as their favorite characters. It was clear that this was more than just a film; it was a celebration of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.From the moment the movie began, I was drawn into the emotional weight of the story. The film picks up after the devastating events of Infinity War, and the sense of loss is palpable. I found myself deeply invested in the characters' journeys, particularly the way they grappled with their failures and the passage of time. The writers did a fantastic job of weaving in moments of levity amidst the heavy themes, and I found myself laughing out loud at the clever humor that felt organic rather than forced.The pacing, while a point of contention for some, felt deliberate to me. It allowed for character development and reflection, which I appreciated. Yes, the action ramps up in the latter half, and when it does, it's nothing short of spectacular. The visual effects are breathtaking, and the climactic battle sequences had me on the edge of my seat, cheering and gasping along with the audience.What struck me most was the emotional resonance of the film. There were moments that brought tears to my eyes, not just because of the stakes involved but because of the rich history these characters share. It was a bittersweet farewell to some of my favorite heroes, and I felt a profound sense of nostalgia as they faced their final challenges.As for the length, I was surprised at how quickly the time flew by. I was so engrossed that I hardly noticed the three hours pass. The film is packed with callbacks and references that made me smile, rewarding those who have followed the franchise closely.In the end, Avengers: Endgame is not just a superhero movie; it's a heartfelt tribute to the journey of its characters and the fans who have supported them. I walked out of the theater feeling a mix of satisfaction and melancholy, knowing that this chapter had come to a close. It's a film I would gladly watch again, not just for the action but for the emotional depth it brings to the superhero genre. It's a fitting conclusion to a saga that has meant so much to so many."
86,"Aug 22, 2019",6,"Unfortunately clumsy. I enjoyed all previous Avengers, and a few scenes in this are very cool and funny, but this one lowers the bar overall. For me the story petered out instead of maintained momentum from previous movies. The dialogue struggles to be interesting, boring sequences at time.Clumsy Avengers fit awkwardly together for group photo, like bad high school reunion. That said, I enjoy Avengers like everyone else for years, just not this one so much.The super-power woman, Capt Marvel, her powers are overdone. Too simplistic, too much power. No reason for her to lose any fight.Was a big collective of all heroes even necessary? Sort of not really.Some scenes linger way too long, drawing out already thin content. And where was Dr Strange? He hardly had anything to say, and very brief appearance, yet he was in possession of crucial aspect of story."
87,"Jun 18, 2019",2,"What's missing from ""Endgame"" is the free play of imagination, the liberation of speculation, the meandering paths and loose ends that start in logic and lead to wonder."
88,"Apr 30, 2019",9,There are so many ways that the movie could have gone. But it is chosen to be this way. So the climax should not be criticised. The story is completed with no proper explanation for the rest of the avengers. Other avengers are not given importance in most of the places. Don't go to the movie if you know the spoilers. My experience has been spoiled by my friends.
89,"Mar 25, 2020",10,A true Marvel movie with overwhelming emotions. Thank you Stan Lee!
90,"Apr 28, 2019",8,"No spoilers here. Story is unexpected and very original. If you thought you knew what will happen - well, you were wrong. First half is a bit slow, but still interesting, with all the small pieces coming together. Second part is full time action, almost as good as Infinity Wars, but a bit weaker in details. I do miss more of Dr. Strange more, but, on the other hand, Captain America was much better than expected. Humor was good, as always.Overall, this is a great movie and a decent ending to the saga. I think everyone will be satisfied."
91,"May 22, 2019",10,It worth Watching It makes you 😢 Iron-man to endgame
92,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"A bit like a compilation album, some really great tracks but generally just filler. Cinematically it was epic, spectacular, CGI filled superhero awesomeness but the film was slow to start (after a brilliant emotional first 15 mins) and I was mostly underwhelmed by the plot. I felt Thor was ruined by the joke and some parts were just cameos for the sake of it. I did sob with my son at the saddest part, but I still feel a bit... meh.... maybe I need to watch it again to see if it's better second time around!"
93,"Sep 27, 2023",8,"""Avengers: Endgame"" soars into the cinematic stratosphere with an 8/10 rating, and I absolutely loved it. The film is a monumental achievement in storytelling and blockbuster filmmaking. The acting from the ensemble cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Scarlett Johansson, is top-notch, delivering emotional and powerful performances. The film's editing expertly weaves together multiple storylines and character arcs, making its three-hour runtime feel like a sprint. The strength of ""Endgame"" lies in its ability to deliver a satisfying conclusion to over a decade of storytelling while still introducing thrilling new elements. The weakness? Well, it might be a bit overwhelming for those not well-versed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The music enhances every epic moment, and the cinematography captures both the grandeur of the battles and the intimacy of the character interactions. Above all, ""Endgame"" carries a profound message about sacrifice, resilience, and the enduring power of hope. This is superhero cinema at its absolute finest."
94,"Apr 24, 2020",9,"Good story. Exciting battle. Marvel fans mustn't have been spoiled before watching this. But it may be not so friendly to newcomers. If the 181 minutes were full of excitements that would be definitely ok but actually there're a significant amount of quiet and peaceful moments, puzzling people who watch Marvel film for the first time. I don't know how would a Marvel fan judge them."
95,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This movie past over and beyond any expectation. Don't miss watching it..... will definitely watch it again and again. ""Endgame"" The name fits perfectly. Total respect"
96,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Absolutely loved it, every character gets a good chunk of screen time and they all use it to full effect, its laugh out loud funny at times, really touching at times."
97,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to a point where a film feels like an actual event. We have been waiting in anticipation for a year to see the final showdown that started in Infinity War. Actually, scratch that. The entire Infinity Saga started way back with Iron Man. 22 films, countless number of heroes coming together in the culminating battle against Thanos. So much anticipation, ticketing app crashes, and going through so much to try to see this on opening night. Now here we are. Does Avengers: Endgame live up to its high expectations? Absolutely. I felt like it was unique and carries the most emotional weight off anything in this universe but it absolutely serves its fans who have been loyal for years and years.The film takes place three weeks after the end of Infinity War. Half of the worlds population have been wiped out by Thanos and now the remaining Avengers (who just so happen to consist summarily of the original Avengers) must find a way to not only defeat Thanos, but also avenge the fallen and find a way to counteract the actions that occurred at the end of Infinity War. As expected the film stars a gigantic cast of Hollywood's best and watch out for the cameos from heroes who have appeared previously in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I really would like to talk about this film in a spoiler review but as with every review on my site, there will be no spoilers. I will say that this film has a unique take almost immediately. The humor and banter is still there as it always is and the character arcs are as fantastic as ever at its near completion. The film carries the most emotional weight as anything this universe has seen. The film has so much fan service. I think if you go early on and with a packed crowd of fans you will see just how much this means to the audience who have stayed loyal to this saga.There were laughs, there were cheers, there were gasps, and yes there were tears. The film feels like it should be the very last that the MCU has to offer but of course we know there are Spider-Man and Black Panther sequels coming. The final battle brings just about everything you could hope for. If you're a fan of the series I think you will enjoy this film as it makes a case of being the best Avengers film. It goes hand in hand with Infinity War, of course both films were shot together.Members of the original Avengers put on performances that do their characters the utmost justice after being on this journey for a decade. The film builds up quite slowly but once the plot takes form and the battle lines are drawn it delivers in the way the Russo brothers know how to. Th action is there, and all of what makes the Marvel Universe such a sweeping phenomenon is always there. Some characters could get more screen time, sure. You have to remember that there are so many characters that the film has to juggle and it does that admirably as it is.The film will be a box office hit for sure and will be well reviewed in regards to the Universe as I can already see. I will be seeing this again tomorrow morning and have the same excitement going into a second viewing as I did my first. I found this to be a very special entry and feel like it ties up so much in such a perfect fashion. If you are a fan of superhero fans you need to see this as soon as possible and should do..Whatever it takes.9/10"
98,"Aug 29, 2019",6,"Hurts to be a fan and say something like this. Avengers: Endgame is a movie that takes too long to mesh, forcing a situation of drama that does not convince in many parts. Practically 2/3 hours of film with many unnecessary dialogues and misdirected performances. The plot holes and bad decisions of the writers is quite evident, except for those who do not expect much from a movie that should end a fantastic universe era built over eleven years. Even so, it has it's high points in 1/3 - great moments, solid acting, and so much fan service. It's a pity that's not in the same level of Avengers: Infinity War at all, but is an 'Ok movie' and don't deserves 10/10 and 1/1 rates."
99,"May 1, 2019",2,"Not the Avengers Stan Lee created. Emasculates the heroes, and attempted to sell a new hero. The character Stan Lee created is completely destroyed. Even the abilities are messed up. This is not Avengers."
100,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"The culmination of the infinity saga,this movie is going down in history as one of its kind. MIND-BLOWING MASTERPIECE.Words can't describe the grandiosity of this film. Worth watching more than once."
101,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"The first 50 minutes set up the movie very well but the second act lacks urgency and focus. The movie comes to a halt and feels as if it's meandering between scenes, not knowing what to do and not being very entertaining. The movie is also highly predictable and somewhat ruins Thanos's character due to a strange character decision. Iron man is given a lot to work with, which is compelling, same with Hawkeye. The ending is somewhat satisfying but also cringe. Overall it is a fine movie, not offensively bad but certainly not as good as it's predecessor."
102,"May 4, 2019",8,I didn't like the acting. Thanos doesn't seem like the badass of the first movie
103,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Definitely not as good as its predecessor but one to be conjured with nevertheless. The movie starts a bit slower than all MCU movies before it and it takes its precious time to get the action going, but once it does, its all forgiven and forgotten. Although predictable, because let's face it, where could they go after Infinity Wars? It delivers on all fronts! There were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and Hawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who found a peaceful way to co-exist. There were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who actually didn't have to say a single word to get the tears flowing. They tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all the glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a forgettable performance. There are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots. Although it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.All considered, a very good movie to end it all, one that you may want to watch it again to take it all in as I will be doing. Well done to all involved and a great big thank you for such a ride that spanned for over 10 years."
104,"Apr 26, 2019",8,This film was hyped so much i couldn't wait to watch it....the film is good but i didnt get the wow factor i had when i watched infinity war.....all the trailers and the online leaks wasted the ending for me....i still love marvel movies and will go see every one that comes out but for me this was good but not as good as I/W
105,"Sep 24, 2023",7,"But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. Really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films."
106,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"For a Marvel movie it was ok, better than most. However this has no place being higher ranked than Schindler's list, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, Every Kubrick movie ever made and many more. People should take of their Marvel fanboy hats and stop shoving these movies to the top. I'm not saying you shouldn't enjoy them, but stop inflating the reviews just based on the fact that you grew up with the characters and judge them on the movie itself."
107,"Apr 24, 2019",10,This movie has the absolute perfect balance of fan service and harsh moments. Lean into the tears and suspend a little disbelief. This movie is everything we needed and more than we deserved.
108,"Aug 17, 2019",8,"Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to ""finish"" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: the character ""powers"" are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other scenes within a given story). That they sometimes ""reduce"" their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, but it's still something that takes me out of the story.What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, I think that's a pretty high compliment."
109,"Aug 8, 2019",9,"Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation."
110,"Dec 18, 2021",10,"Endgame has such a special place in my heart, it's so beautiful, but at the same time so painful to watch. The storyline is overall amazing and the characters is so amazing. Everything about this movie is incredible. This movie has it all , those cute comforting scenes, action scenes and fights, those scenes when you just can't stop crying it has it all. Endgame is such an experience. This movie is and I think will always be the turning point of marvel."
111,"Nov 3, 2019",9,"A nice conclusion to the saga, it'll give you nerd chills"
112,"Apr 30, 2019",7,"The first half of the movie have some slow and boring scenes, not an end game type movie, missing action and the power start, the second half and the last 40 minutes marvels best, can watch multiple times only for thanos"
113,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"After what happened in Infinity war, the only question I had was ""how can they top that?"" That question was answered, no other superhero movie will be able to beat Endgame. The movie just gets better and better and the huge finale is done spectacularly and has everything you want to see and much, much more. The set up for this was perfect, the build up to this was perfect, and the pay off was perfect. Avengers: Endgame is done flawlessly and perfectly."
114,"Apr 25, 2019",9,"No one goes to see a comic book movie expecting to see an art house film. It happens sometimes but it is not the normal. What you expect to see is a fun movie with some philosophical concept and some emotional depth, comic books were never just about the action. So is this a great film? I don't care. Watching it I never stopped to think if there are plot holes or if the cinematography is good, I just enjoyed it. And enjoyed almost everything about it. The Russo brothers are not the new Goddard or the new Bergman (or even the new Spielberg) but they are talented and intellectual people, they had a goal and they delivered by not only doing fan service but also story service. The MCU has a great future.So, is it a great film? Comparing it with cinematic masterpieces I could give it a 6-7/10. Comparing it with other blockbuster movies I could give it a 12/10, it's that good..."
115,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Everyone shines in this movie. Directed to the fans of these 10 last years of Marvel movies. A thank you, beautiful, tragic, fun. The emotion stills my words just after seeing the movie. Have to see it twice again to do it justice."
116,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"A must see, Best movie ever!!!! I really think this is the best super hero movie ever made!!! Thank you Marvel"
117,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Just watch it by yourself. This movie has more deep story, and will mix all your feelings as well. Thanks god nowadays kid has a great role model for them and thanks god that i was born into this era when this Comic Book Movie exist."
118,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Excellent, the Best of the Best ! Great 10 years of MCU 🍷"
119,"May 5, 2019",10,"It could definitely be improved, but every possible flaw can be totally overlooked because of the 22 film build-up, it seems earned completely for every joke that doesn't land (which isn't many) there are a hundred fan-service moments that make you forget any wrongdoing Following up such an airtight film like Infinity War would be superbly difficult, making the 11 years feel worth it is an achievement and The Russo Brothers deserve praise."
120,"Jun 23, 2019",7,"After all the hype, I expected to be extremely wowed. But I left feeling kind of meh. It was extremely long and dragged in several places. I felt like Infinity War was better overall. Good movie but seriously overhyped."
121,"Nov 15, 2019",10,"It's just freaking amazing!!!! It's the greatest movie of all time and it just changed the whole cinema history. Nothing ever could even come nearby or defeat this movie. It had emotional moments, action, comedy, its just the mixer of all movie's. This is my first favourite movie. And this deserves an Oscar, not one but billions. Love you 3000!! -George Vignesh"
122,"May 7, 2019",6,"Spoiler free..... For those who have given this a 10, take that with a pinch of salt, it really isn't. There's a strong argument that suggests infinity war was an overall better film. Endgame drags in places as it tries to cram in so much more, building up to a noteably predictable ending. The direction some of the characters have taken this time around is polarising and didn't work for me. Some key MCU characters going forward we're also given limited screen time which, for those keen to know what the future holds.. I'm not sure anyone really knows now.Whilst the changing of the guard will be welcomed you do get a sense of, this is really the end of a great journey for marvel. Barring a series of solo follows ups and a play in the tv series space we're unlikely to see an avengers style films of this magnitude anytime soon!I've always been a fan ever since the iron man graced our screens, however for me, they have slipped up quite a few times along the way (Thor series) was poor and captain marvel was average."
123,"Dec 27, 2020",2,What a waste of fan service. Absolute cringe and quantum plot will blow your mind
124,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"What a brilliant finale to a wonderful saga, the infinity war saga will surely go down as one of the great cinematic achievements of all time. Avengers Endgame brings together all the characters we have grown to love and finishes the saga in a spectacular way. WHATEVER IT TAKES"
125,"Jan 12, 2020",8,This movie was really good. I remember my self screaming at the movies sooooo bad along with every other fan! I watched this movie 2 times at the cinema! It was something else! But still something was missing! I don't know what but I gotta say that infinity war was superior! At least for me!
126,"Aug 18, 2022",10,"Despite the garbage marvel has become in recent years the storytelling, acting and conclusion to decade long character arcs is top class in this film. To the reviewers giving this a 1, you need to get a life and respect what we have witnessed as it is unlikely we will ever see this again given the infiltration of wokeness in Hollywood.Go see this movie if you haven't. It is great."
127,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"I have never wrote a review about any movie I watch. I just feel that I have to document what just touched my heart. Growing up in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia, without cinema was hard for me. I remember I used to wait months after the movie comes out to watch it online. When I was in college, I used to travel to Bahrain to watch Marvel movies. I enjoyed watching all the movies. I have developed a strong connection with all the characters. I feel what they feel, I understand what they understand. It became a part of my life. My friends, even my close friends, used to make fun of me for watching superheroes movies. They always say that there is no story it is all CGI, what are you watching it for? They do not understand the creativity of developing characters and flashbacks, let alone understanding a complex plot with many planets and universes. I am so happy that I made it to the U.S and watched the movie in the opening day. With that said, Avengers: Endgame is one of the most epic movies I have ever seen. I laughed too loud, cried too hard, and smiled a lot. I will not write any spoilers, I am not that guy, but I wanted to share some of the feelings that I experienced in these epic three hours. The movie has everything perfect the writing, acting, and directing are all outstanding. If there is one wish that I could have in life is that watching this movie with someone I love who have the same admiration for Marvel movies. To the creators, actors and actresses, people behind the scene, and everyone participated in creating it I cannot thank you enough for what you have done. I know this is not a perfect review but I had to share it somehow."
128,"May 8, 2019",9,"After waiting for a year, Avengers: Endgame hit the theatres and shattered a number of box office records worldwide. But, was it really so perfectly great? No.Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried it's best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least.Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical.Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is messed up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't.Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience.Rating.Score : 8.9/10Grade : A"
129,"May 21, 2019",9,"It's fair to say that this is a fitting climax not only to the avengers movies, but a large section of the Marvel universe. The film is action packed, generally keeps you at the edge of your seat, and remains faithful to the characters. It's long, but quite necessarily so."
130,"Oct 2, 2019",6,"Seems that they separated every good parts and put them in Infinity Wars and leftovers into this one. Plot is ridiculous, with most of the heroes unused/underused. Are those actors even involved in making of this movie? It is more like clip show episode, made of chaotic parts from previous Avengers, where even CGI quality is different or in the worst case, they combine new things into old scenes, so difference in quality is even more obvious.Time will lower rating of this movie when hype stop. Now, this movie is first one in All time worldwide gross, so it will be more criticized (Avatar can rest now).I watched it in full cinema in first days of screening. We laughed on stupidity of some scenes (every one in theater). At the end, on exit, after 3 hours of painfully boring and bad movie, nobody talked about it... Just wanted to leave this misery behind it."
131,"Aug 19, 2024",9,"The story picks up after the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War, where Thanos wiped out half of all life in the universe. The surviving heroes must regroup and come up with a plan to undo the destruction and defeat Thanos once and for all. The film explores themes of loss, redemption, and the lengths people will go to save those they love. Endgame excels in its ability to deliver on fan expectations while also providing surprising and emotional moments. The film's pacing, while slower in the first half, allows for deep character development and reflection, making the final act's payoff even more powerful. The climactic battle scene is one of the most epic and visually stunning in cinematic history, bringing together nearly every hero from the MCU."
132,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Endgame 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Don't watch it with preconceived notions of what it's going to be. Forgive it's minor faults, it's a bloody great super hero movie."

134,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"My mom is very critical about movies she's not interested in most of them unless if one her favorite so called 'good looking' actors are in the film. ""I really really liked the movie, at first I thought 'oh god when is it gonna end so I can go to sleep' but I loved the movie and it was better than the previous one that you made me watch"" is the exact thing she told me so as you can see she's not a geeky die hard Avengers fan and we watched it at 1a.m. by the way and she really loves her sleep and the previous movie she was talking about was Infinity War."
135,"Oct 7, 2019",10,"One of the best movies I have ever watched ... ""Avengers : Endgame"" is the best Ending of 10 years of The MCU .. the movie was dramatic not just a superhero movie which the heros win at the end, No the movie has drama and the acting was too good from all the characters .. That's why I liked so much, It Isn't like any superhero film, It Was Epic !"
136,"May 7, 2019",10,"This movie was incredible, it did everything I wanted it to do and every character had their time to shine, the film was the culmination of 22 MCU films and ten years of buildup and the film pulled it off beautifully. This film could have turned out as a mess if it was in the wrong hands, but the Russo brothers have masterfully pulled off an awesome and emotionally satisfying finale to the Avengers franchise and MCU series even though we are getting more films with ""Spider-Man: A Long Way From Home"" coming out later this yearOverall, the film was everything it needed to be and the hefty 3 hour run time was definitely more than necessary. The film did everything I expected and much much more, closing a chapter on pop culture history and a franchise loved by billions, it was as close to perfect as a film like this can get"
137,"May 2, 2019",8,Expectations always comes with a slightly disappointment
138,"Apr 11, 2024",8,"It must be admitted, the Russo Brothers are really good at covering up all the secrets for the film Avengers: Endgame. In fact, the spoiler scenes that were spread on social media didn't seem to have a big impact. Joe and Anthony Russo know what they're getting into with all of this. They want this ultimate conflict to be so complex.Avengers: Endgame truly works as a blockbuster movie experience. If you empathize with the difficulties faced by the remaining Avengers after the events leading up to and including Infinity War, you will be satisfied with this film.The duration of three hours which initially felt too long was no joke. In fact, almost every minute is well spent, except for a few comedic scenes that could have been left for the Blu-Ray version. The film Avengers: Endgame managed to tie up the entire MCU story with a beautiful, emotional, heart-wrenching and hopeful conclusion which is an undeniable achievement.As good as it is, there are still flaws even though they can be forgiven. Because the plot is dense and there is a lot to tell, some things seem a little messy. There is some questionable logic and raises many questions, including the ending of the film. In fact, it slightly breaks the established rules of all the MCU films before this one. However, despite that, the film is an emotional and satisfying journey."
139,"Apr 28, 2019",6,Infinity War was way better. Endgame is super slow and even at times pretty boring. The third act somehow misses the mark and falls short of being the epic finale we've all been waiting for. Overall it was okay. It wasn't horrible. Definitely not the best either.

143,"Dec 4, 2023",9,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, the result of years of work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie with a dozen subplots colliding, and familiar faces from over 20 other movies. It's really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration. The blunt thing you probably want to know most: It's hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed. It checks all the boxes, even ticking off a few ones that fans won't expect to be on the list. It's a satisfying end to a chapter of blockbuster history that will be hard to top for pure spectacle. In terms of sheer entertainment value, it's on the higher end of the MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few legitimate thrills along the way."
144,"Apr 30, 2019",6,"I'll keep it as short as possible and spoiler free, I didn't expect this movie to be better than Infinity War but it was a disappointment, unfortunately... The cons first: a) This movie is almost an MCU clip show. I won't spoil the plot but to me it felt repetitive. Like eating reheated pizza. b) Too slow. Do you remember the action sequences and the fast pace of Infinity War? Forget that. Literaly there's almost no action for the first one hour and a half! c) Dispropotional screen time. Unlike infinity War, the majority of superheroes have too little screen time (I'm talking about fighting scenes). Again, I can't spoil anything but some heroes have two or three lines and a ten second action scene. d) Thanos himself. Unfortunatelly Thanos wasn't as good (or should I say... bad) as he was in Infinity War, he almost feels like a heavy bag with a few lines (and I mean few). e) Predictable plot (maybe that's only me). f) The final big battle feels hasty and bad edited. There are too much going on on screen with a very little time for each character. g) It has a pessimistic and dark tone. Now the pros: a) Solid conclusion. The movie is a solid conclusion of MCU's phase 3 (and perhaps MCU itself). b) Good humor. That's not a surprise for a Marvel movie, there's plenty of tasteful humor and in the correct amount. c) Good performances. Nothing to add here. d) No political agendas. I hate it when it happens and thankfully this movie is ok (there are one or two cringeworthy scenes though, but nothing importand). e) There are some good action scenes and the effects are awesome. Overall, it felt rushed and it lacks the majestic feeling of Infinity War. I can remember plenty of scenes in Infinity War which gave me goosebumps, unfortunately there's none in Endgame... Final verdict: 6/10 when I compare it to Infinity War (it's unavoidable), 7/10 as a stand-alone MCU film. In my opinion it's the third best Avengers movie (right below Infinity War and the first one). I didn't regret watching it at the theater, in fact I suggest you to do it, but I won't watch it a second time..."

Funny, emotional and inspiring.From the cameos, the references, the scope, and the audience reactions, the silences and the time jumps, all well crafted and edge of seet stuff.I am late to review but after watching again recently, I felt the need to remind myself by reviewing it. My only criticism is that one character didn't get the kudos or fanfare they deserved and it was noticed, hopefully the replacement of that character will make up for it.All I'll say is.... On your left!Incredible thank you 💕"
148,"Jul 15, 2019",10,It is the best movie I ever seen.this types of movies came once in a decked.the actor and actresses are give there best. I ONLY just wanted to say see this movie
149,"May 10, 2020",10,"This movie concludes 22 movies over a span of 11 years. This journey has been a emotional roller coaster, starting from Iron Man in 2008. Endgame properly complements its predecessor Infinity War. This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a finale. After 22 movies that are all feature length.. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. In this movie everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. It amazes me how such a large cast was accommodated pretty well in the movie. If you are a Marvel fan make sure you carry tissues with yourself. Russo Brothers have done a great job. It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the hero's. The jokes were funny and it really felt like a family. All the visuals looked amazing. From the spaceships to the planets the CGI was flawless. I loved it. It showed that the creators put their heart and soul into making this movie. Avengers Endgame is an absolute treat. Do watch this movie."
150,"Nov 17, 2021",8,"This film did nearly every Marvel/MCU fan justice. To see the epic conclusion of the Infinity Saga spanning for over 10 yearsThe film itself is great. The usual cast and crew teamed up to produce such an awesome film. The story could've maybe been more exciting during the middle. But that climax scene, wow! Definitely watch this film (but you need to watch every MCU film first)"
151,"Nov 16, 2019",10,"That is horrendous for Hawkeye.""Was it juice pops?"" ... Cute.""Lebowski"" ... Killer dialog :)I see the Iron Man help style has trickled down to everyone.Hulk fake mad :)You thought The Squad was tough..."
152,"May 7, 2019",2,"It's long winded...easily could be half the 3 hours.... Superhero movies are about battles and heroes...not crying and moaning. Watching iron Man wimper off was such a let down. After watching every avenger movie, I am so disappointed. Only 1 good battle, and it's over too quickly. So so so disappointed...I'd take any other avenger movie over this one."
153,"Jul 14, 2019",10,Just name is enough! Endgame is biggest blockbuster of the year.
154,"Oct 16, 2019",10,This movie picks up after the devestating events of infinity War that wiped out half of all living creatures. In this movie you can really feel a sense of urgency from the avengers. And the way the characters are taken is all very pleasing. The acting is some of the best in an avengers film. The 3 hour run time is not a problem what's ever and I could've happily sat watching it for 5 or even 6 hours without feeling it dragging on.
155,"Jul 13, 2019",10,This is the movie everyone will love to see.. But you should be a true mcu fan to feel the film
156,"Jul 16, 2019",10,"A perfect film in everything, never boring and a wonderful ending"
157,"May 5, 2019",2,"Nothing really happening ....Captain Marvel is in it for a bit...Black Panther was in it too, not sure whyDramatic scenes purely over the top....just seems like they tried to fit all 5000 Avengers into this film and actually forgot about the film3 hours, I'll never get back .......one good battle scene tho"
158,"Apr 27, 2019",8,"Couldnt help feeling that Endgame is to Infinity Wars what Dark Knight Rises was to Dark Knight.A good follow up but the bar was already set too high. Very entertaining, with a satisfying ending, but got there after quite a few plot holes and unanswered questions.It felt like the writers wrote the ending first and then tried really hard to take us to that end, regardless of what plot holes they were forced to leave in the wake.PS didn't really like what they did to Thor and Hulk. Good for laughs maybe, but the characters deserved better"
159,"Oct 10, 2019",10,A perfect blend of all Marvel super Heroes in One movie ....Thats the Avengers End Game
160,"Sep 6, 2024",9,"Marvel's The Avengers is a landmark in superhero cinema, bringing together multiple characters from previous films into one action-packed, cohesive narrative. The chemistry between the ensemble cast-particularly Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America-elevates the film, while Joss Whedon's witty script keeps it fresh. The final battle in New York is a visual spectacle, combining stunning effects with thrilling choreography. While the plot is fairly straightforward, it excels in delivering fan service and setting the foundation for future Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films."
161,"Apr 30, 2019",6,"By no stretch of the imagination does this movie deserve a spot next to Dark Knight, Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Inception, Shawshank Redemption or any where within the top 100 movies. It was alright. Not revelatory. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. That was awesome. They captured the emotion perfectly, it was sad, but appropriate. This had some feel-good moments with massive collaboration from most of the entire universe. Also, this movie could possibly have elevated to an 8 if they put Deadpool in...that would have been awesome and hilarious. It was not overly thought-provoking. It was just a little above the average popcorn Marvel movie-nothing truly profound, just fun verbal quips and too much fighting and too many missions that somehow ends alright (not amazingly though)."
162,"Apr 27, 2019",8,"I've been a fan of superheroes since I was little kid. When Iron Man was out, I couldn't believe it, it was so good. But, I completely fell in love with the idea of the MCU when I watched Captain America: The First Avenger. Here we are, 10 years later, 10 years loving fictional characters, loving the actors, loving the movies, to have it ending like... well this.I think they had a great idea, a great way of saying goodbye to the most beloved characters, but I think the movie fell short. I was more emotional during the ending credits than the whole movie. I felt like I needed more, like there was many things left unsaid. Maybe I'll love it the second time I watched it? I don't know honestly, for now, I am a bit disappointed with this one."
163,"Apr 28, 2019",6,So unfair to the Thor's character. I felt the character was totally treated bad. Even the Hulk's character was wasted.
164,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"EXCELLENT BETTER THAN INFINITY WAR !!! BETTER THAN A LOT OF SUPERHERO MOVIES AND IT SEEMS MARVEL WINS !! WHEN ARE THEY MAKING BATMAN VS HULK???? COZ THAT WAS ACTUALLY A COMIC ,,GOOGLE IT !! AND JOACHIN PHOENIX AS THE JOKER IS MAKING ME KINDA HAPPY AND HOPEFUL FOR THE COMIC BOOK ART MOVIES THAT ARE SOMETIMES GREAT LIKE WATCHMEN AND DARK NIGHT and YES TO ENDGAMESTAN LEE WOULD BE PROUD OF ENDGAMENUFF SAID"
165,"May 3, 2019",10,"The film once again managed to include all emotions, just like infinity war did. At the beginning it was not what I was expecting, and from I've gathered this has caused many people to disregard the whole film, but the fact they tried something different makes it unique. The film still reached a point where the whole tone flipped and this is where it became even better. This is the only film I have been to see that has made the audience applaud, that must show how these films have been able to create such a connection with the MCU community to the characters."
166,"Oct 7, 2024",10,Endgame is definitely one of my favourite films out there. Love the cast there all great and it's got a really fantastic plot and follows on so well from infinity war which in my opinion was slightly better. However endgame does not mess up infinity war but in fact enhances it and makes it much better by covering up lose ends that were left in infinity war. Beautifully done with a great cast great acting lots of sacrifice and an absolutely beautiful ending that for me will be hard to match. This film is definitely practically perfect in my opinion. It may get very very slightly slow in parts but it is still a fantastic film and well worth the watch.
167,"Jul 10, 2019",10,A breathtaking experience. Marvel played it's top trump card and blew alway any competition from start to finish. The battle scene is simply one of the if not greatest pieces of cinema ever. But it kept on giving after this. Anyone who gives this film less than a 10 is selling it extremely short.
168,"Apr 24, 2019",10,It's the best way possible to end properly the avengers saga.
169,"Nov 5, 2019",9,"It's not Perfect as we imagine, There is so many curious in avengers infinity war ending & that's why people came to watch this movie in theaters.. It's not the best movie in Avengers Series."
170,"Apr 24, 2019",8,Good movie but a bit long especially during the 2nd phase (could skip 30min ez) and the end is not as epic as Infinity was last year...harcore fans will absolutly love it for sure for other it's just a good ending.
171,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"OMG... I haven't have had such an experience watching a movie as it took me down memory lane like crazy. I was laughing, crying, in a loop and was lucky to watch the movie without any spoilers...So strongly urge everyone to not spoil the movie and let fans enjoy this amazing movie and culmination of last 11 years of marvellous MCU...Please don't listen to negative reviews, as they might be either from hard core DCU fans who can't see Marvel success. ;) or people who just expect a Schindler list from Marvel, though it comes close to some of the most amazing and great drama movies of all time.Nuff said, Fantastic movie..."
172,"Apr 25, 2019",10,Avengers: Endgame was mindblowing and awesome. It is the best MCU movie ever. It is even better than Avengers: Infinity War and it exceeded my wildest expectation.
173,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Honestly, no MCU movie has got me so emotionally involved in it's story and Endgame does just that. Not only do I get my CGI epic fight scene fix, I also felt closure with the first 6 avengers this is truly a masterpiece and a Must Watch for any movie buff, casual and child."
174,"Jan 17, 2021",2,"Unlike Infinity War, Endgame was there for only fan service, which is not something one should look for in a movie."
175,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one... A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second! Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years. Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around. It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket. Stan Lee would be proud! Nuff said!"
176,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"Too many jokes which make the movie very long to watch, but the end is totally worth it! Nice way to end those beautiful movies!"
177,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This movie is everything that fans and viewers wanted it to be. It clearly shows that the makers have put their heart and soul into the movie instead of just making money out of the popularity.It is 3 hours long but never felt like it. The sequence of emotions in the movie is sad, cheer, laugh, cry and repeat.Watch it before it gets spoiled for you!!!"
178,"Apr 24, 2019",10,It's a great closure. Epic as people called it. Heroes..
179,"Apr 27, 2019",6,"My First movie review ever and thats because I love Marvel absolutely love it to core and the expectations I had from this movie were just way too much, and after watching I am so disappointed. Infinity wars was just so much better, End Game has way too many plot holes and some very lazy writing. I wish I liked it after such a long wait but unfortunately I just couldnt"
180,"Jan 9, 2021",1,"Bella SGI e tutto ma il film è velocissimo, non si capisce un c***o. Nel complesso è carino ma ha una valutazione troppo alta."
181,"Apr 24, 2019",8,Totally worth a watch and it caps the series off well but it's pacing is a bit erratic for my tastes.It'll be interesting to see what comes in the new phases. I won't say more because this movie deserves to have none of the secrets spoiled.Go see it guys.
182,"Apr 24, 2019",10,The words can never describe how awesome the movie was. I brought my own diaper to last the 3 hour movie.
183,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Thank you for making us happy and satisfied. It's worth waiting for. 🍻
184,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Absolutely perfect conclusion of 10 years of MCU and the excellent ending of Avenger. Don't read reviews, not even spoiler free one. Go see it you won't Regret it! 10 on 10!"
185,"Apr 30, 2019",6,"Believe it or not, I expected this storyline. That Thanos would destroy the stones and Avengers will move on until they find a way to travel back in time. I said I hope it wasn't using Quantum realm because it would be repeatable. And that's exactly what happened.The movie is plagued by plot holes. I will not go over all of them but I spent over an hour after the movie listing all the plot holes to my daughter. The biggest and the most ridiculous one is that the Avengers had only enough Pym particles for one round trip each. Movie made a big deal about this. But towards the end, Thanos uses one vial of Pym particle on his ship with everyone on board. With thousands of minion creatures on it. With no special ""Quantum"" suit or equipment. You mean to tell me Avengers could've just got on a vehicle and teleport all together with one vial? And with Hank Pym back now, they can time travel at will from now on. Or go back in time to get more just like they did in the movie. This completely ruins the Marvel Universe.Avengers can travel back in time where they first made the Ironman version of Infinity Gauntlet. Borrow it, defeat any villain with a snap, and return it to exact moment. Avengers of the past will understand since they did same thing when retrieving the stones.Also now everyone is Antman. Everyone can shrink, go to Quantum realm, and time travel. Nothing special about Antman now. These are just fraction of all the plot holes.There also was a huge plot hole fail in The Last Jedi when Holdo sliced Snoke's mothership by going lightspeed. Which ruined the Star Wars Universe. And these rivals that plot hole.Their version of time travel is a big mess too. It says past and future is not connected and changing past doesn't effect future but there are parts where it shows the new past effecting the future. And they were making fun of Back to the Future."
186,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"DISCLAIMER- This is a spoiler FREE reviewWell, here we are.After 11 year's of top quality entertainment and planning that started all the way back with 2008's surprise smash hit Iron Man (do you feel old yet? I sure do), this part of Marvel's world domination comes to an end with what's likely to be one of, if not the biggest film's of all time, The Avengers: Endgame.It's a somewhat odd, occasionally emotional and fitting experience sitting back and concluding this part of the Marvel universe and while we know there's countless more Marvel film's coming our way, Endgame really does feel like the culmination of year's of hard work and adventures, that while not perfect, feels like a fitting tribute to what's come before and what still lays ahead.It's incredibly hard to talk about Endgame in depth without ruining the narrative the Russo brother's and their team have created but suffice to say the creative minds behind the scenes have given us another top quality piece of blockbuster filmmaking, that's likely to please diehard fans and more casual cinemagoers alike, the only problem is, when compared to it's genuinely surprising and perfectly paced predecessor, Endgame does feel slightly more formulaic and long in the tooth.It's picky for sure, but Infinity War gave us a Marvel experience that was unexpected, hilarious, emotional and epic and while Endgame has this in parts, it's not as all encompassing as last year's experience, even if by the rulebook, this was never going to be the case when tying up so many loose ends and finalising so much of what has come before it over the year's.A lot of these endings and plot tie ups will please those that have invested so much into a series that has been operating on an extremely high level for a number of year's, it's just that Marvel almost outdid themselves in Infinity War, making the more by the numbers plot threads and leaps of logic found in Endgame more highlighted than usual.The other minor nitpick with the film is Endgames much talked about epic 3 hour runtime and while the film starts with some unexpected and emotionally charged instances, there's a clear late beginning and middle section of the film that at times drags and cover's similar ground one too many times, even if by relative terms, the runtime in the Russo's film never is too detrimental to the fun to be had.This fun comes in many forms, with particular highlights being Thor's new found lifestyle, the Hulk's more prominent role and Captain Marvel's addition to the Avengers family, while the films big action scenes (that must be said aren't that abundant) are a sight to behold, with Marvel once more showing off their ability to handle spectacles as good as, if not better than, everyone else.At the end of the day, it's been an incredible period for Marvel, with arguably no outright failures and an abundance of big winners, we've been spoilt for 11 straight year's and while Endgame may not be the best of the best, it's still a mighty fine and emotionally charged finale that does the beloved cinematic universe proud.Final Say -While not as surprising or even as Infinty War, Endgame is still a top quality and fitting end to so much good work that's come before it and while it's sad to say goodbye to this particular era, it's exciting to see what lays in store for Marvel moving ahead.4 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of 5"
187,"May 8, 2019",6,"Really, people think this is like 8.9?This means i am really getting old. I love Infitinty war and i went to the theater like super-hyped. During the movie i wanted to like everything, then when it was over I thought, man it was bad. I am sad, how is this possible?I am ok that this is being bad. But why people think it is ~8-9? it is a good 6 max 7, but noooo..."
188,"May 18, 2019",2,The movie is just very bad writing and is an epic failure for it lacks a coherent acceptable digestible fathomable sensible reasonable story or plot .. just sucks so bad that it hurts So much is wrong that I can't begin .. but for some reason people are lying .. even critics
189,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"A colossal conclusion, a proper ending for an epic saga. It brought you to the beginning, it remind you of all the years you have invested. Then boom, here is that dessert that make you overwhelmed and craved at the same time. It closed one door to open up another, there is still a new journey ahead of us. Great execution by Joe and Anthony Russo!"
190,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"One of the best movies I've ever seen , simply EPIC , Enough said"
191,"Apr 27, 2019",10,The genre has been completed. It was the best superhero film ever. It completed an epic journey of superhero films.
192,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Avengers Endgame is truly one of the best epic films ever made.. This film literally made entire theatre whistle, laugh, cry, sad and shout their lungs out!!! There are few moments which will make every marvel cry, no matter how hard they hold onto...."
193,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"End of era. Worth watching. There is every thing which is required in a perfect movie. There is drama, action, emotion, every rhiThank you Stan Lee."
194,"May 8, 2019",7,"Tamed Hulk, traumatized Ironman, fantasy of yesterday - Cap America. what did I do with my hair - Cpt Marvel . Dr Stranger things and many more with fault of not their own were part of the final movie in one of the most successful and entertaining spectacles of the past decade. The movie itself was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway.PG-12 rating is a culprit here. If movie's rating was higher I am sure that scenes filled with nothing would be at least more electryfying but because this is a movie aimed at future and former fans, the lighter representation of after apocalypse universe was the only thing Disney corporate machine could have come up with and still get away with achieving PG-12 rating. Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here.The final stand off was amazing though and I will say that it is worth the price of admission. When I will be rematching Endgame on blue ray I think I will just skip to the last few chapters just to experience all this wonderfully done explosions and amazingly done fights. It was just epic and the team definitely raised the bar here.Overall the movie was ok but it did not top IW for me. This one will still be the best Avenger movie."
195,"Apr 27, 2019",10,This is the best movie I have ever seen! This movie is such a love letter to the fans of Marvel. I have never had so much emotion drawn from me in a movie. The story is so amazing and a beautiful way to end the Marvel Infinity Saga.
196,"May 3, 2019",9,"It was a marvels fans dream. Loved it all the way. The perfect end to all the fans, giving moments of full action. Avengers: Endgame shows an incredible connection between all the movies of this amazing universe developed among eleven years. Yes it slows down a bit. But over all a visual treat I must say."
197,"Jul 26, 2019",8,"This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it's still up there for one of their stronger movies. It's not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies. TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie"
198,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This was truly the first time that as I was watching, I felt like I immediately recognized a movie's future significance. The duology of Infinity War and Endgame, I believe, will be remembered as the pinnacle of superhero movies. That's all there is to it."
199,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Don't enter the theatre with preconceived notions of what you wanted them do do with this movie, no. Instead let it unfold as Infinity Wars did, an unexpected storm. This movie was epic, the acting, the cinematography, the story, the mixture and combinations of joy, pai, and suspense...all the years of a finally woven Marvel heroic tapestry. Finished. But in a way that leaves me yearning for more, but relishing the memories of the characters I once simply read about as a child from the 60s to seeing them in the big screen like never before. Man this was a great movie! A must see. Hollywood Oscar folks time to stop overlooking these cinematic treasures. There were some Oscar worthy performances in here. Phase was of the age of marvelous Marvel heroes hit it crescendo. And it was one for the ages!"
200,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"It's going to be very difficult to top this, and it's also very difficult to express how amazing this film is without spoilers, so I will just keep it brief and say that you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't see this film. It is an epic event in every sense of the word, and you will never forget seeing this movie. The last hout will never leave your memory as long as you live. It is the epitome of action sacrifice and heroism and encapsulates the never ending battle of good versus evil. Go see this movie. See it twice."
201,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"The script was slow moving and often lazy. After being so precise and covering all the bases moving up to this movie, it seems Marvel really let go on this one. They left several loopholes unexplained. Overall the movie was worth watching, but I thought Infinity Wars was much better."
202,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"As an avid MCU Films fan, the Avengers: Endgame was by far THE BEST MCU FILM. For 10 years MCU has always delivered blockbuster movies and Endgame felt like their BIG BANG or LAST HURRAH; a trophy for all the 20 MCU films we have seen and loved.Sitting through a 3-hour film never felt this quick but it was not short of satisfaction. It gave me all the feels, from laughs, to tears, to being in awe, to surprises.However, I wouldn't recommend watching this without watching all the MCU Films before this.Avengers: Endgame is WORTH THE HYPE. This is the finale that will stay with us."
203,"May 3, 2019",6,"Not what it was pumped up to be. Captain Marvel, useless. Thor, broken. Stark, hitting well above his weight. Captain America annoying as ever. Ant-Man, completely left out of the loop. Hulk, not incredible at all."
204,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"I went in to Avengers: Endgame with high expectations and they were still shattered.First off, nobody is ready for the 3 hours that conclude the Infinity Saga and if you think you are then you're wrong. This is easily the best MCU movie so far and one of the best superhero movies of all time. The visuals are stunning and the cast and crew goes all out to give us the cinematic event of a lifetime.The movie features a strong and engaging plot with directors Anthony and Joe Russo clearly showing us that they know what they're doing. Character arcs across the board come to a satisfying conclusion and just remind us why we, as fans, have invested this much in these films the past 11 years.Bring your tissues, because this is without a doubt the most emotional adventure that Marvel has put us on as an audience. Emotional scenes are backed up by Alan Silvestri's stunningly beautiful and goosebump-inducing soundtrack, with many callbacks to previous MCU movies that prove that this is a worthy conclusion.Incredibly astounding and emotionally affecting end to a saga that started with a billionaire in a cave with a box of scraps and a scrawny kid from Brooklyn who just wanted to do the right thing.Go see this film; you will not regret it at all."
205,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I laughed, I cried, I exclaimed, I cried, I laughed, I cried and then I kept crying.Rest assured, the writers do these characters every justice they deserve, by closing long running arcs beautifully, albeit, sadly. It is a painful goodbye to the Infinity Arc but they've done it superbly. The endgame of over 22 films, a saga spanning 11 years has culminated into something so powerful, so awe inspiring on the screen, I urge every one to watch it to feel firsthand, the beauty, the pain and triumph of our heroes.The movie picks up right where the previous left off. It allows the viewer some time to cope with the devastation wrecked by Thanos in the previous film. It is remarkable and therefore worth noting that every trailer issued for this movie comes in the first 20 mins of the movie and hence everything afterwards is such a whirlwind. The movie gives nod to some of our favourite moments in the past films and still continues to give.You will have many naysayers. Dont listen to them. The movie is powerful. The effects, the music, the story, the emotions. Its honestly a hell of a ride.Stan Lee is up there somewhere, smiling. And we too will learn to smile through our tears."
206,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Warning: This movie will exceed your expectation!!!Marvel has quite mastered the art of story-telling!The trailer has been teasing us with pretty much nothing and what a way to promote Endgame.In the rarity of today's world, where most trailers almost tell you everything in 3 minutes.This review is about to reveal nothing just like the trailer did other than what an epic conclusion!!Tears 7/10 Intrigue 9/10 Mystery 8.5/10 Ending 9.5/10p.s. There is no post end credit scene. Save yourself 10 minutes of time."
207,"Sep 4, 2021",9,"This movie isn't perfect. But i feel like Endgame is actually pretty amazing because it has more characters than any other movie and somehow manages to give a conclusive ending to all of them along with 11 years of the Infinity saga. Ngl, My life was complete when I saw the Portals scene."
208,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie, but it feels like one. Every character get an end to their arcs, and the film itself is a great conclusion to 11 years of movies, all of which have led up to this. I wont spoil the actual plot for those who haven't seen it (the trailers have been incredible at not revealing anaything), but I will say that it is full of surprises, shocks, laughs and tears. The fact that the film manages to be THIS good more than makes up for its few flaws. The final battle is probably the most fan-pleasing, epic and emotionaly packed action sequence in any superhero movie; it was the culmiation if 11 years of characters we've come to love and care about. This is what superhero movies are all about."
209,"Apr 24, 2019",10,This time I m speech less best movie of the year and so emotional comedy and some out of action this is snap of fingers
210,"May 13, 2019",2,"This was supposed to be the final movie that crowed the franchise and Infinity War set high expectations. I was utterly disappointed. The plot doesn't make sense and throws away a lot of character development, to the point that some of them are just shallow version of what they were in other movies (and could become).But what really annoyed me was the sentimentalism that permeated the whole movie. It is like you have to shed a tear for every character and the movie is trying to make you cry in scenes that don't move the plot forward. If in Infinity War they really stroke a good balance between action and emotion, here they just are there for the sake of it."
211,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"What it needs to be a hero? Power? No. Sacrifice? Yes. It's not the end. There will always be a fight worth fighting for. There will always be a dream to avenge. Never ever give up. Do whatever it takes. And be a hero. Thank you MCU for giving us 10 years of lovely memories. To teach us about love, friendship and determination. It was a wonderful experience, thank you again."
212,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"After 21 films worth of waiting, Marvel has finally reached the conclusion to the Infinity Saga in Avengers: Endgame. The collective movies had mad billions of dollars, and captured the hearts of comic book fans around the world. The prior entry, Avengers: Infinity War added a certain sense of gravitas and catharsis to the Marvel Universe. The prior film left fans not only devastated, but with more questions than answers with it's cliffhanger, serial ending. So how does the conclusion fare? Are the Fallen avenged? Is Endgame worth the hype?One of my greatest praises of Shazam! was the amount of personal consequence it had. One of my biggest criticisms of most superhero movies is that the consequence is constantly about saving the world. This then makes saving the world a redundant outcome that we know the superheroes will eventually solve. With constant resurrections and story revisions, the Marvel Universe greatly lacked this. Yet even though the world saving was still the primary conflict of Endgame, the story contained personal consequence for each individual character that made the film far more endearing to the viewer. This filled the film with incredibly written, visceral moments of joy, pain, and everything in between.The amount of story-boarding that went into the film is insane. The run time is long, but a necessary evil to the human bladder to tie up so many loose ends within an incredibly convoluted plot. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has so many characters, and Endgame gives resolution to their individual strife, while raising questions that can be pursued in future films. It gives each character their own space in the spotlight while concurrently sharing it equally. It is absolute brilliant direction by the Russo brothers.I cannot justifiably call Endgame the singular greatest superhero film of all time. Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy is still brilliant, and did not need 21 films of buildup. Yet it absolutely rivals the trilogy with the first Marvel film that takes a chance with the ultimate pathos. The film rewards the fans who have seen all of the films, even the poorer entries, while inviting new fans with instant accessibility. I never checked my watch, I never felt the need to get up from my seat, which is something that has never occurred for me within a three hour movie. Not every direction choice worked as intended, not every story point was logistically flawless, but it still works. I laughed, I cried, and sometimes even did bof. Not both, but BOF. I can't give Avengers:Endgame any grade worse than perfect.(Grade: 10/10)"
213,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"""Perfect"" is the only thing I can say. Could not imagine a better ending."
214,"Apr 24, 2019",10,It was amazing. The hole movie was so good a would watch it again and again. WHAT a experience
215,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I like this movie too much. so delicate, so perfect, I cried several times, I have to watch it a few more times."
216,"Apr 30, 2019",6,"I'll keep this short and spoiler free.Simply, it doesn't compare in story, performances, characters, structure, or even excitement to Infinity War. Infinity War far surpassed expectations on all fronts where unfortunately Endgame comes short.It's a fun movie and there's great and powerful moments. But ultimately there wasn't nearly enough suspense, and the plot was far too messy and borderline lazy.It was a good movie but I'm sad to say a disappointment in regards to what came before and in regards to the place it holds now in the history of the MCU.If you're just looking for a fun movie and are willing to ignore major plot holes, lazy story elements, and lacklustre character choices hopefully you can enjoy it for what it is. But it's no Infinity War; and although it has redeeming elements (which on their own could've been part of a great film) it's overall a disappointment. Lower your expectations. I hope you like it better than I did."
217,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Worth it. 11 years and 21 movies later, the journey was an unforgettable one. The emotions conveyed on my face have not done justice to this epic finale. What are you sitting and reading this for ? Go and watch the zenith of Marvel Comics come to life."
218,"Nov 27, 2019",10,And some parts brought me to tears. The cast was phenomenal and I think every superhero got to have their spotlight.
219,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"ENDGAME is not what you're expecting, yet it's also exactly the impressive epic you're chasing. It takes our central heroes to new places and wraps up Marvel's decade-long journey so beautifully. The ending is emotionally overwhelming. I'm thankful to the entire team for giving us a special movie that will long live in our heart."
220,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"What a brilliant way to follow Infinity War. Actually, Let me look at it more vaguely. What a brilliant film. This superhero blockbuster is not the usual to say the least. Most emotions we feel day to day are heightened at certain points in the film, causing you to laugh out loud, whimper, clap, or cry. This is DC's ""the Dark Knight"". This is television's ""Game of Thrones."" This is the Endgame."
221,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Just came back from the movie theater after watching the movie. Not gonna give any spoilers or any kind of stuff that will ruin it for you after reading this. I'm just gonna say if you're a Marvel ultimate fanboy, a regular Marvel viewer, only watched Infinity War because of it's hype or just a normal movie goer that wants to watch an incredible movie it doesn't matter. This is in my opinion the pinnacle of cinema and I don't think I'm ever going to see a movie in the theaters ever again (except this movie again 2-3 more times). Just. Go. See. It."
222,"Apr 25, 2019",9,"Marvel has completely taken over the film industry, and the addition of this film will speed up that process even more. This film is enjoyed the most when the audience is knowledgeable of the marvel cinematic universe and it enhances the emotions of the audience due to the bond forged through the commitment of watching all 21 films before Endgame. If someone were to ask me: ""Is it one of the best films you have ever seen?"" I would reply: ""It is the best film if all time, in its own way"" ""Its stands alone, away from every other film, because it is so different to anything i have ever watched before."""
223,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Spectacular, Emotional, Joyful, Unexpected, Filled with Actions.. Avengers Endgame is lifetime achievement.. It's the conclusion of 22 films.. It's like end of an era.. So please watch it in Imax or 3D and don't spoil the movie.. You'll enjoy it very much.. The ending is very satisfying.."
224,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"Avengers: Endgame is a well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It ties in many different storylines from previous films and allows you to reminisce while also saying goodbye to characters you've known and loved. This film has some flaws, of course, but it also made some bold choices and surprised me a number of times. I laughed. I cried. I loved this finale to the Infinity Saga."
225,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"That movie was so emotional, yet full of action. Funny, yet deep with meaning. The plot line was so well thought out, that it gave you the impression it's impossible for a human brain to actually pull this off. Every little detail clicked, every scene had its meaning. I've never laughed and cried and were at the edge of my seat all at the same time, in a single movie. I thought it was gonna be just a re-do, a battle and then bye-bye Avengers era. But, no. It was so much more. It was an epic way to mark a 10 year old journey. Russo brothers, you blew me away. You better get an oscar for that screen writing. Oh, and RDJ you are a brilliant actor. You deserve all the millions they gave you. EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY."
226,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Man.. that was absolutely amazing.. well done.. i'm speechless, best movies ever.."
227,"Aug 30, 2020",10,This movie was awesome. It showed how much we need people who can inspire us and how to win battles. Congrats to all the people involved in the project and RIP Chadwick Boseman. I am shocked to hear that he is dead. I wish his family to be strong.
228,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This movie is the best marvel have ever made.A 3 hour masterpiece , don't read the reviews just go see it ."
229,"Apr 25, 2019",10,From the beginning to end the movie is perfect!!!!
230,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Just came out of the cinema and the first word coming to my mind is 'EPIC'. This movie concluded the past 11 years in the best possible way or even better because a movie like this seemed to be impossible. The great battle scene is the very best in cinematic history, to be honest it is almost as good as an orgasm. I am happy that I could witness it - what is more on the premiere day. This masterpiece made me prouder than ever to be an MCU fan! Well done! Pretty sure I will pay to see it again... and again... :)"
231,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"To witness the end of this legendary franchise is bittersweet. This movie makes one cry, laugh, smile, think, cheer, worry, and imagine. It is perfection. Everything from acting, directing, sound effects, and storytelling is flawless. I watched it twice already and I am eager to watch it again."
232,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"The second the iconic Marvel intro began, I was crying buckets. By far the best super hero film of all time. A complete finish to the most epic saga. Bring two buckets... one for your popcorn and one for your tears."

234,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"It has been, a little under eleven years since I saw the first iron man movie with my dad in the movie theater, at the time none of us really could imagine what was in store for us. the infinity saga is one of the most complex stories I have ever seen strung together within the cinematic universe. Endgame has everything I could have asked for, humor, plot twists, world-class acting, life lessons, heartbreak, and most importantly closure, and although not all of them are great, I am certain that I one day will make my kids watch the entire saga in the hopes that they will find them as special as we did.To The Russo brothers, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee, and all the other geniuses behind this amazing adventure, Thank you for telling us your story."
235,"Apr 27, 2019",9,"Avengers Endgame Review Score - 10/10 Avengers Endgame could be well described as the most complicated storyline in the entire Marvel history not only because it had to wrap up a story of eleven years but also because of the complex solution to an inevitable situation that The Avengers try to achieve with the avenging not being the major part of the story. The three hour runtime was well utilized by giving more time to establish the characters' humanistic attachments and the losses they suffered; not only in this movie, but from the very moment they've been incepted into this franchise. Unlike the previous outings, the characters differ in their choices and these contrasts in their choices lead up to one massive and satisfying final battle which may not end the entire MCU, but certainly does end a glorious era of the long franchise. The entire movie, especially the final battle was a huge fan service as it included everything a Marvel fan could possibly dream of. PS: There is no Post - Credits Scene in the film, but it is worth waiting for the entire credits to roll."
236,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"After watching the premiere tonight, this movie is the best one I have ever seen, Better than Dark Knight. The laughter is on another level with some serious cry because we are in the endgame now, it is expected. The way they have assembled all the 21 movies in 1 epic 3 hour screenplay is completely mind blowing and astonishing. The Russo brothers are pure epitome of perfection to showcase MCU at its best. Thank you MARVEL STUDIOS and STAN LEE for giving us such epicness. Some might not like it, might not remember about it but not us - is what I will tell myself even after 10 more years."
237,"May 13, 2019",2,"I am a huge Marvel fan and have loved the previous Avengers films so went with high Hope's for this, unfortunately I was disappointed beyond belief. Long, slow, dull scences make up most of the movie with only about 10 minutes of actual action. Main characters are sidetracked for less popular ones and the whole film moves at a snail's pace. It really felt like they had run out of ideas and this is just a money making film. So, so let down and would not recommend.. recommend it to anyone"
238,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Marvel has over the years delivered movie after movie and we have been watching. Not only did they give us the ending we needed but they did it in a way which connected everything we have seen through the MCU. I just want to some how forget that the MCU exists so that I can watch all the movies all over again. Will definitely be seeing Endgame again in cinema.
239,"Jul 14, 2019",8,Avengers endgame might be long but it feels like the fastest 3 hour movie I've seen. Everything works even with the few plot holes. The action is evenly paced and works where they put it and all leads up to the greatest climatic battle scene in a long long time.
240,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"This movie was build up since 2008. This has been one of the best MCU moments they ever shown. Not only this Movie was epic,but also emotional as well. This movie shown what is like to have an emotional roller coaster journey.Amazing conclusion to an epic journey.A fitting climax that takes infinity war to another level.I am Already planning to see it again.This is the movie that Marvel fans deserved."
241,"Apr 28, 2019",10,One of the greatest movie of this century. 11 years worth treasure.
242,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"I saw this with my entire family in a theater. It was house full with too much clapping n whistling n some of the dialogues went bouncer. Will watch it again but I feel it is not on par with Infinity War. In Infinity War, the war sequence n the fight scenes were all shot in broad daylight n that too in an open field of Wakanda without the fast paced camera tricks. It was visible who was fighting who but Endgame's war sequence is shot in the dark with too much fast paced camera tricks. At times it became hectic to make out who is fighting who. The entry of Thor during the war in Infinity was epic but in Endgame it was duds. The entry of Captain America with the background sound to save Vision in Infinity War was again epic but in Endgame it is not at all exciting. Rocket's one liners were good though."

246,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"A fitting way to launch the next phase of the Marvel Universe, so satisfying and the 3 hours disappeared in a blink of an eye. Will definitely watch again in general release."
247,"Aug 9, 2019",10,"A wonderful and amazing movie for all the fans. So much emotions, so many nostalgic moments, and action, humor, drama! We get to see all the superheroes and some more loveable characters. I feel sorry for those who try to find scientific logic in a movie about superheros. You really need to focus on what's important. Just enjoy!"
248,"Apr 30, 2019",7,"I cried and laughed and blah, blah, blah. CGI was great, but I can't get past all the subtext to create plot rules and then completley blow them put of the water. I can think of about 5 minutes of scenes and a slightly different way to handle the last moments of the battle that would have covered those holes. I can't believe no one said ""Hang on a minute. This wont work."""
249,"May 14, 2019",7,"Not going to go into any spoilers I just felt that overall the movie was average, it did a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. The acting was decent, the action scenes were good if few and short and the pacing wasn't atrocious.But there were flaws, Brie Larson could have been replaced by a cardboard cut out, some of the twists made little sense and the big fight was rather unsatisfying and had a really cringy scene (you'll know it when you see it)Ultimately it's worth watching but the people rating this a 10 are overly hyped or wearing blinders because there were more than enough flaws evident throughout the movie. Basically go in expecting an alright action flick and you'll enjoy it."
250,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Every single marvel movie serves as a stepping stone to this very movie. This movie is complete on every aspect from the beginning to the end. Every Avenger plays a significant role that tells their story to the full. Filled with action, emotion, comedy and a great storyline, this movie will blow everyone away in 2019 and beyond.Thanks to Marvel and the Russo Brothers for making a movie that will make history in my personal books."
251,"Nov 30, 2019",10,"Everybody, I mean everybody was in this movie. Endgame is basically an epic superhero movie. It will be interesting to see if they can ever top this on this kind of scale.I regret not seeing Avengers in the theater. This is the type of movie that needs to be watched on the big screen. I avoided it because I thought it was hype and only for the most diehard fans. However I think moviegoers who aren't really into this genre can appreciate Endgame.It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the hero's. The jokes were funny and it really felt like a family.The visuals looked amazing. From the spaceships to the planets the CGI was flawless. I loved it. It showed that the creators put their heart and soul into making this movie. Avengers Endgame is an absolute treat."
252,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Only 1 word for this movie. WOW. This is so spectacular and great movie.
253,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"Overall this was a good movie. Character screen time was definitely not split as well as the last outing. Just seemed like a long build up for a poorly lit end battle. Again, a good show but not up to the standard that I have grown to expect for Marvel."
254,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Thank you Russo brothers! Thank you for living up the dream of every Marvel fans! I am not sure if there will be a better movie than this in the upcoming years. But this has got to be the best superhero comic movie ever made! If you are hyped with all this reviews coming in, you have another thing coming your way. Stop whatever you are doing and do whatever it takes to the watch this epic movie of the year! A finale well written and a movie worth every penny of your money. Bring your kids, family, friends and have the best 3 hours of your life like i did. We were never ready for this. We never did.... #WhateverItTakes #Endgame"
255,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.Is Avengers: Endgame OK for children? If your child has seen any MCU film then they'll be OK with this. The film has fair number of bad words, but the violence is on par with what younger fans are accustomed to. For example, there isn't any one instance that's as graphic as when the monster ate the businessman in Shazam!, but there are sustained action sequences that might test those 8 years old who haven't seen an MCU movie before."
256,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I'm among those people, who normally don't engage in writing reviews. But this time I really have and want to. I rewatched the infinity-saga prior to Engame's release and there couldn't have been a better ending to it then the one it got. It really has been an epic ride and I feel privileged to have been able to be a part of it. Though only being a spectator, I feel connected to these characters, they are like long know friends. Endgame is the epic and monumental end to the saga which began over a decade ago. And oh it is more then worthy to be the last milestone on this incredible journey. I went through so many emotions watching this, joy, pride, happiness, sorrow and a sense of being alive and what it means to be human. Just watch it, you'll see what I mean, I really don't promise too much. It's truely hard to say goodbye to so many beloved characters, but they get the ending they deserve and will always be the franchise's core. Thank you for this amazing journey Marvel."
257,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"After 11 years and 22 movies, Marvel Studios brought us the most ambitious movie, the greatest culmination, it is nostalgic, sentimental and completely unexpected. All the characters are so well-balanced, to each one is given plenty of screen time to development. If you're a marvel fan you'll feel like you're finally complete, you've never seen anything like this before, there are many references to all the 22 movies and there is a certain inevitability about the plot, there are plenty surprises. The movie present us an incredible balancing between nostalgia and novelty, you will scream, laugh and cry, it is the Marvel recipe elevated to the highest level. There's just so much in it, that I can't even write about it without spoiling everything. This is not the end for Marvel, but it certainly marks an ending for several of the characters we've watched and loved over the last decade, there will be more superhero franchises but it's hard to imagine any one being so culturally resonant. It is the grande finale."
258,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"11 years later , 21 films later . A pure masterpiece was born . 3hrs of heartmelting hardhitting , chest thumping film. Thank you stan , thank you Russo and thank you marvel for this beautiful film to look back on after I have kids and I show this to them and say , I lived a beautiful life."
259,"May 5, 2019",10,"I love you three thousand times,when i was a student I fell in love with Iron Man. sorry my English is not good, I can't express my feelings in words. 11 years ......Thank you. My 11 years. Perfect. It's really done. I love you three thousand times. AVENGERS,ASSEMBLE."
260,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This is a historic movie. The story that Marvel and Disney crafted for over a decade comes to its conclusion in an epic 3-hour film that is for the ages.All the characters, some of which we've known and loved for years and others we just met, get their share of love and their time to shine, with cheers and applause ensuing several times. There were tears aplenty, but also quite a few laugh, in particular from a character you don't usually think of as comic relief. The movie takes time to show us the unbearable loss of Infinity War and how the Avengers each deal with it, before a way to bring back all of the victims of the Snap appears. But don't think you know how this is going to go because whenever you think THAT was the big twist, there's probably another one coming.New abilities are revealed, emotional arcs are fulfilled and heroes change as Marvel lays the ground work for its next phase that will officially start after the release of Spider-Man: Far from Home this summer. Endgame ends with an open door to the MCU's future, but for the first time since its beginning, the movie does not feature a post-credit scene, leaving us wondering what's to come.I feel like this is the kind of movie I'll be happy to say I saw in the theater the day it came out 30 years from now when they remake it for the third time. This is a once in a generation cultural phenomenon and I hope you go see it in the theatre because you will not regret it."
261,"Apr 24, 2019",9,I am a huge fan of marvel. And I was pretty sure that this movie will be legend. And to me it is LEGEND.Scenes was awesome. The scenario was awesome.I think every marvel fan should watch this movie...
262,"Apr 28, 2019",10,What an amazing film! I wouldn't change a thing about it. The film is very long but worth every minute. A good mixture of comedy and action.Advice: go to the toilet before you watch it!
263,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Before reading this, I just request you to take two minutes and think of best possible conclusion to this 22 movies saga. Thought of one? Now multiply the awesomeness of your ending by a 100 times and still this movie will surprise your assumptions! If a critic like me who just can't stop finding errors in a movie failed in finding big mistakes in this movie, I think you should believe this one is just perfect! Sure there were a few tweaks, but I am ready to ignore them seeing how smoothly the whole 3 hours of the runtime just passed by. I was literally sticked to my seat for 3 hours, even during the interval, I was like I want to see the whole movie in one length. Tell you the truth, I was not much impressed with Infinity wars or Ragnarok (not even mentioning captain marvel here xD), but Russo brothers just nailed this one. After waiting for 21 movies, we deserved a perfect end, and we got one. 10/10 from my side. If 21 movies lead to this, I am ready to watch another set of 21 for such a perfection!"
264,"May 8, 2019",7,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great. There were some very epic moments and some very sad moments. However, it was way too long. Without getting into spoilers, I found myself pretty bored within the first hour.80% of EndGame was really just a fan service/tribute to the MCU fans who watched all the previous MCU titles (most of which I saw). Even after the ~30 mins climatic battle (which was the best part of the film), however, the movie somehow continues to drag itself on again.I also felt there were some plot holes in the story/concepts; I had trouble understanding how it all worked.The humor was alright, but it is of typical MCU-grade comedy. Again, some jokes were good, while other jokes were just dragged on or plain cheesy.Overall I liked Infinity War better"
265,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"The only word I could muster after the screen cut to black was ""Unbelievable.""The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an achievement in film like we've never seen before, and Avengers: Endgame is the perfect culmination of this journey we have been on over the last decade. I genuinely cannot comprehend a more perfect way to end this story along with several character arcs.Endgame takes all of the best things from the previous 21 films and packs them seamlessly into the 3-hour runtime that still somehow leaves you wanting more. All of the main characters give pinnacle performances here (one in particular, which you might have a guess but I will refrain from saying here).Hours later, I am still mostly speechless. Nothing else I can put into words will be able to do this film justice. You simply have to experience it for yourself.If you're a lifelong Marvel fan, you will swoon over this film. It will touch your heart. It will go down in history. Now stop what you're doing and go experience Avengers: Endgame."
266,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"No spoilers!!Being a sceptic of Marvel movies for a long time, I had low expectations going into Endgame. I didn't love Infinity War, but I wanted to see this film opening weekend to avoid spoilers and see how the 10-year culmination of the MCU concluded. Well, I was pleasantly surprised with the film. It's not without its issues, but Endgame felt like one of the most unique and captivating Marvel films to date. I was very surprised at how easily I was engaged throughout the 3-hour runtime. The film breaks down into three parts, each part having its pros and cons. Personally, I thought the first act was the weakest and overstayed its welcome. Despite that, there were still some interesting parts that helped flesh out the aftermath of Infinity War. The second and third act felt very original and had many surprising moments that kept me guessing what would happen next. However, there were parts that felt VERY fan servicey. Of course, some of the fan service was fine, but at other points it felt like a little much.One of the great things about this movie was that it broke from the simple MCU formula. It has a much different story than any of the other MCU films and utilizes much different plot mechanisms to make it feel more original. The emotional range of the film was another thing that felt different to me compared to many other MCU films. I thought the humor in this film was handled much better, causing me to laugh multiple times. Not only was the film funny at points, but it also had some sad, depressing, exciting, and thrilling sequences. This film, unlike some other MCU films, was able to have some very serious moments and did not have to cut the emotional tension by inserting a cheesy one-liner.Despite it being a much more original and emotionally driven film compared to other MCU films, it did have some shortcomings. I think that some of the fan service took me out of the film because it felt either overdramatic or forced. There were times were I caught myself rolling my eyes at how overdramatic or socially 'woke' the movie was being. One scene in particular felt like a blatant advertisement in the middle of the film, which was jarring and cringe worthy. There were also many moments of the film that could have been explained to help bring more tension, but instead were brushed over in order to fit everything into a reasonably lengthed film. I think there were parts that should have been cut or shorted and other parts that should have been extended. Lastly, I thought that Thanos was misused in this film. I was excited to see his role in this film but was left disappointed by his role as the villain.As someone who wouldn't consider themselves a Marvel fan, I had fun watching this movie regardless of it having some issues. I would definitely recommend it if you have been following the MCU at all recently, but I probably don't need to do that because everyone and there mother is going to see this. Overall, I thought it was enjoyable and quite possibly my favorite Marvel film.P.S. It feels satisfying to have this chapter of superhero movies come to a close. I hope that it will make way for more innovative and interesting films, whether they are superhero related or not."

Some jokes fell flat and some of it i felt just appeared at the wrong time 2. Some songs i felt were placed or played at the wrong time too 3. Some people might have a problem with the pacing of the first act but i personally loved the slow pace), but this movie doesnt need to be perfect and there are obviously better superhero films in terms of quality like Captain America: Civil War, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Logan, The Dark Knight and so on but come on man. Those movies are great movies but Avengers: Endgame is magic/one-of-a-lifetime-event!Never have i once laughed, cried, cheered and screamed this much in a movie. I have also never thought i could get this much of a rewarding experience from rewatching all 21 MCU films. WOW! Thank you Marvel Studios for this experience!See it without any spoilers, i beg you!"

272,"May 9, 2019",7,"Infinity war was overall a better movie, but this movie had the disadvantage of being the follow up to that movie. A good chunk of this movie is essentially remembering what happened during infinity war. The struggle against Thanos in this movie... It just isnt done in a satisfying way.Before Infinity war came out last year, it was already confirmed there would be another Avengers follow up this year. It was speculated that Endgame was actually going to be called ""Infinity war part 2"". Unfortunately, this is Endgame, but it SHOULD have been Infinity war part 2. I know that is very vague, Im trying to be vague, but essentially because of what happened in Infinity War, it was pretty much impossible to make a sequel which feels like it even is the same story with the same consistency & epic feel. Or at least, that is not what we got.Captain Marvel kinda sucks in this movie. She is a boring character with magic powers. Ughhh great. In hindsight, the tease in Infinity war was cool, but it makes it into a big letdown. And this is kind of the story of the whole movie, if Infinity War was the teaser. (Although it isnt quite that bad, this movie is still pretty good, unlike Captain Marvel in it.)"
273,"May 1, 2019",8,"Spoiler Free!Was endgame good? Yes Was endgame fun? Per usual Was endgame non stop action? Kind of Was endgame $400 million to make? YesIf I gave you $400 million to make a movie it wouldn't be to difficult to pay top actors, writers and fund state of the art animations.Endgame is a relatively non-stop rollercoaster of Marvel nostalgia. Great end to a storied franchise? Kind of. This is nowhere near the cinematic greatness of LOTR: Return of the King. That was a true film through and through. Endgame is monster budget with 80% boring monologue and corny jokes. If that's what you enjoy then all power to you.Endgame has less action than any other Avengers film which I found incredibly disappointing and a let down.Would I recommend you to see endgame? Don't be silly, this is generational movie. Generational in the sense of big money, big actors, mega marketing and big answers to a beloved storyline of multiple hero's. Marvel movies are popular because we have been told by everyone we have to love them. If you have one bad thing to say about a Marvel movie, you will become more isolated than Tom Hanks in Castaway. Well worth a watch but please...pump the brakes."
274,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"The avengers go out with a bang in this movie. It's fun, it's emotional, it's action packed, it has surprises, it does the ending of the avengers movies justice. It starts out slower but it's all worth it for the end. It had moments where people cried, clapped and gasped. Go see it!"
275,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Film full of emotions, happiness, fun, anger and sadness, there is a bit of everything"
276,"Apr 27, 2019",8,"This movie was the end of 22 movies... Supposed to be the most intense movie of all time. Yet infinity war had way more emotion and way better script. I even think that age of ultron was better. All they focused on was linking all the 22 movies into one and fan service. I feel for that reason it wasn't as impactful as infinity war. The way they end the characters stories was ok, i would have done it differently and done something that would make your heart drop, like they did in the first 5 min of the movie. And also they did something to a certain character and all i can say is WHY, SO STUPID. 7 may seem like a descent rating but i am very disappointed because this movie had unlimited potential and now i'll never get to see the endgame i wanted to."
277,"May 4, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame (SPOILER FREE) Review:After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe. Avengers: Endgame is literally one of, is not the, most anticipated film ever. This review is probably going to be shorter since its spoiler free and I have to be vague. I should have a spoiler review up soon (Monday is apparently the day we can talk about the spoilers according to the Russo Brothers). So this is a little late. I saw it last week Saturday and just saw it again last night. I wanted to see if it had the same effect as it did on first viewing. I'm pleased to say that I absolutely loved this film and even more than Infinity War. It's a great story that brings all 22 films in the Infinity Saga to a bittersweet end. The plot is much darker than any Marvel film. The first act was a drama where they're all realizing the events of what happened and it gets a good perspective for the audience. We saw in Infinity War that it affected the superheroes and some people but it makes us all think of the entire universe. It's tragic really. This is also when we get the most character development in any of the films. We see their true feelings. Now I could go on and on about how there wasn't a single bad performance by anyone, but I would like to talk about one. I'm currently on the petition that Robert Downey Jr. should get an Oscar nomination or at least a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. I believe this is his peak performance and he put all his emotions into it. The scenes at the beginning and end are his best though. Some brought me to tears. It's a very emotional film and I don't know how one could go in to it with at least tearing up. So Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus, amazing job with the script. No line felt out of place. Everything came off natural. And also the Russo Brothers did their finest work directing and they're some of the best right now. There's so much to say about those but that's all I can say without giving it away. Now for the technical aspects. Alan Silvestri's score was interesting and beautiful because it had the original melodies like the previous Avengers films but this time he created new melodies that, for me at least, are just as memorable as the Avengers Theme. Also my favorite score of the year so far. The visual effects were good as usual and worked well with the chaos of the action, especially the final battle. Speaking of battles some say you could leave for the action since it's all the same and there was too much going on, but I strongly disagree. There is no time to get up and leave during this film. The cinematography was at its best of the franchise with Trent Opaloch as the cinematographer. And I think I'll leave my review at that. For more content I will have my spoiler review soon. I think this was an amazing film that brings the series all together. I'm pleased to say I liked it more than Infinity War and it's my favorite film of the year just beating Us. Therefore this is my first perfect film of the year. Please go see it if you haven't. I think this film is special and one you can never forget.My Grade: A+"
278,"Apr 30, 2019",6,"You wont miss anything entertaining. I didnt know what to expect from this final film, but I certainly wasnt expecting to watch arguably the slowest moving Marvel movie ever made.

Who on earth decided to portray Thor as an overweight bloated drunkard?..That person should be hit with Thor's hammer. In a way I am glad that it has come to an end.

And here it elevates the emotions of every MCU fans that too right from the stone.I always wanted to brag/say about Endgame but that will end up with too many spoilers. So the plot remains unrevealed.The movie has an ensemble cast feat. all the ones you've known and with the outnumbered super heroes teams up to defeat Thanos, one of the most powerful villain of MCU. He stands out tall in this one too. All superheroes has their own spaces, imprinting themselves in everyone's mind. Endgame portrays the emotions and personal stories of the superheroes and was really touching.Even though Endgame is Visual Masterpiece but rides through the emotions whole throughout but also will make you laugh. Thor, Antman, Hulk and Rocket leads the laughter squad. Captain America was not my fav. hero, but after this he has a special spot in my heart. Iron Man, he was brilliant. All the superheroes will grab a special place in your heart for sure.Russo brothers did a wonderful job in terms of writing and in directing. Endgame is visual treat to the eyes and the finale battle was also well convincing. Technical aspects were outstanding in terms of Camera, Score, CGI, Editing, Art, etc.It's a long 181 minutes movie but you will not take your eyes even for one second.A must watch in Theaters especially in IMAX. a MASTERPIECEI will go out with 10 on 10"
289,"Apr 24, 2019",7,"The movie was great, there's no doubt about it, but that was it. Coming off the shock value that Infinity War brought meant that nothing in this film surprised me, actually there really wasn't any surprises- everything was just as you'd expect it, which was slightly disappointing in itself. I remember after infinity war, people in the cinema were speechless, crying, sobbing, hugging each other - there was nothing like that here. I wish there were more surprises. It was also a little slow overall but at the same time a good celebration of the last 11 years."

Before the smartest guys in the milky way start talking about the loopholes in the time travel theory let me tell you that this is a comic book movie and not a time travel documentary so please take it with a pinch of salt.. Having said that, the movie gets a lot of science right and the best part is the storyline, related Easter eggs and references to the previous movies and the sheer comic book on a larger than life magnitude that makes this movie the best comic book movie ever made...

Endgame is funny, emotional and provides more depth to main character heroes. However, leaves so many important things out of focus despite its 3 hour runtime. Also, surprisngly feels like the Russos missed many great opportunities to make the movie better.Go and see it! Still important piece if the puzzle."

299,"Oct 28, 2019",9,"When I walked into the theater for my first viewing of Endgame, I was prepared to see a great superhero movie. I expected some massive fight scenes, a few emotional gut punches, and to walk away with a generic positive message about overcoming obstacles. But I could have never guessed that night that I would cry like a baby, go completely numb from pure awe, and leave the theater with a fresh take on what it really means to be human. It was a night I'll likely remember for the rest of my life.It all started back in 2008 with the first Iron Man, which was soon followed by several other movies based on popular superheroes from Marvel comics. These superheroes became known as Avengers, appearing together in several blockbuster hits to fight world-threatening enemies. Endgame is the culmination of 22 movies across 11 years, and the anticipation and pressure from the fans were higher than ever before. But somehow, Marvel managed to produce an overwhelmingly satisfying conclusion that met or exceeded all expectations.The premise of Endgame's storyline is fairly simple: defeat the mad titan Thanos after he wiped out half the universe's population and bring back everyone he killed. However, it ends up quite complex, dealing with quantum physics and time travel. The directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, do an admirable job of making the storyline easy to follow, bouncing between dozens of different settings and timelines without feeling too cluttered. There are also a surprisingly low number of plot holes considering that the movie deals with time travel.When it comes to pacing, the film has some minor issues. It sometimes feels unnecessarily drawn out during some of the middle sections, where the movie takes a less serious tone and the stakes don't feel quite as high. But it more than makes up for it with an action packed beginning and ending filled with shocking surprises and adrenaline rushes to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.One of the movie's most impressive feats is how it is able to include so many characters without making a single one feel left out. The main characters of this movie are the original six Avengers, which include Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. Apart from the Hulk, who unfortunately does not get much of a spotlight, all of their characters develop beautifully throughout the movie and have several major moments to shine. Iron Man in particular ends up almost the complete opposite of his selfish, egotistical, and ignorant past self. Even Thanos, despite being the main antagonist, has a very interesting arc that affects his grand motives as he learns more about humanity's flaws.As we have come to expect from marvel, the production quality is as good as it gets. The acting performances from all the cast members are easily some of the best they have ever done. Whether through dialogue or simply just facial expressions, the actors and actresses do an amazing job conveying their characters' emotions. The visuals are stunning, with a vibrant color palate and awe inspiring cinematography. The movie relies heavily on cgi, but it is done so well that everything looked completely photorealistic. Accompanying that was a stellar soundtrack by Alan Silvestri that masterfully matches the tone of each scene, elevating them to new heights. ""Portals"" in particular is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, and it still gives me major chills every time I listen to it.The movie particularly excels at creating a very atmospheric feel to many of its scenes, using it's soundtrack and visuals to immerse the viewer into its vast world. Some of the best examples of this are in an early scene with Iron Man in a spaceship, which wonderfully captures the melancholic but peaceful tone of the scene. And perhaps the most prominent example is in the iconic ""Portals"" scene, which emanates sheer awe with its beauty and scope, starting slowly and naturally building up to an earth-shattering climax.A common criticism with superhero movies in general is that they are mindless ""popcorn entertainment"" only good for action and surprises. However, with Endgame, this could not be further from the truth. Through the Avengers' personal struggles and Thanos's quest to make a perfect universe, the film goes the extra mile in showing how the world and its people are far from perfect, but our lives can still be beautiful. This idea is especially shown within the deeply moving final few scenes.Avengers: Endgame is a wonderfully thrilling experience for its audience. But it goes a step further and shows us why cinema and storytelling are so important. As Endgame illustrates, emotions are defining characteristics of humanity, and whether good or bad, they shape our lives and allow us to grow. What better way to experience these emotions than through some amazing stories?"
300,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Will tug on the old heart strings and will be one of the best movies you will ever see.
301,"Oct 19, 2019",10,"This movie is honestly the Empire Strikes Back of Marvel. A lot of movies aren't nearly as good. Firstly, the CGI, the action, and just the special effects on the heroes, they're top notch. Second, I know that this movie doesn't exactly have the action throughout because of the time travel plot, well there's a quite a bit of action scenes, but it gives us a enjoyable throwback to the old MCU movies and saves the big blockbuster action for the finale and there's nothing to be said of the finale except for one word: EPIC. Lastly, it really put a good use of the 11 year buildup of our heroes. And you really careabout all of them. And everyone does career-best performances. But the star of the show is RDJ. He's always been great as Tony Stark, but I don't think he was as good as he was in this movie. He honestly deserves an Oscar. And don't listen to haters of this movie please. Just watch it and enjoy it."
302,"Sep 5, 2019",10,"I saw this in the theater, It was awesome, and just when you think it can't any better it does..."
303,"Apr 28, 2019",8,"Pros: top notch cinematic, over the top action, nice concept of time travel.Cons: chaotic scenes with so many characters, forced cringe moments."
304,"May 2, 2019",6,"There must be a lot of brainless fan boys highly rating this movie ... compared to its predecessor (Infinity War) Endgame was a real let down. I won't reveal spoilers. But I will say the pacing was very bad.... very very slow at the start to the point I was nodding off in the theatre .... the movie before had great pacing of action, drama and comedy...... Endgames first half was just boring. Also balance of heroes in the first movie was done much better than this movie which really should have been called Captain America & Iron Man + Avengers. And time travel as a plot device is a very lazy way of solving issues ... I cringed when that came up ........ Thanos and his lieutenants were a threat in Infinity War... in this movie they felt really dumbed down."
305,"Apr 28, 2019",9,From the beginning to end the characters are very alive and at the beginning we never going to believe that is gonna happened but it does and after that the movie been a roller coaster and the climax is the generator of goosebumps and at end for me its a pain to dilute the truth. Over all its an perfect ending to the greatest franchise in marvel universe.
306,"Apr 28, 2019",7,"That's it, not even a drop of sense on this one. They completely ruined Thanos Hulk and Thor and after that they dug a hole so deep and had no idea what to do with it. I don't even want to write anymore because the more I think the worse it gets.. they rushed this one too fast. With so many possibilities to do it, it's really sad to end an era like this."
307,"Apr 29, 2019",1,Watching this movie has me seriously thinking of inventing my own time machine. I would either go back and prevent the Russo brothers from making this movie or at the very least go back in time and not buy tickets to this movie. All my hopes that had been built up for a year were shattered. Dropped. Smashed. Shattered.
308,"Dec 21, 2021",8,"Where ""Infinity War"" created havoc, ""Avengers: Endgame"" promised closure. The film is jam-packed with re-enactments of previous films' relationships. It practically requires that viewers do their homework by watching (or rewatching) a dozen previous films. The emphasis switches from lavish, effects-driven demonstrations of universe-saving heroism to the more personal cost of heroism. It establishes that whoever possesses the six all-powerful Infinity Stones may accomplish almost anything by just snapping their fingers. Because there is so much territory to cover in the film, it skips over introductions and presents Captain Marvel's entrance as a foregone conclusion."
309,"Nov 22, 2022",10,"The Russo brothers took what was seemingly a impossible task of not only meeting expectations but of wrapping up a storyline 11 years in the making and they knocked it out of the park.To take all these characters, their storylines, their archs, and bring it all together to fit in one single film and for everyone to have their moments is what I can only imagine to be an extremely difficult task yet the cast and crew made it look easy. While I would've wished for more screen time from certain characters ie Ronan it was still well done.Now there's obviously no such thing as the perfect film but this comes damn close. An amazing cast, fantastic visuals, phenomenal score by Alan Silvestri, and something Marvel lacks today good writing.This was the film of a generation and the theater going experience of a lifetime, I would just like to say thank you to the Russo brothers and the entirety of the cast and crew for the hard work and passion that went into the making of this phenomenal film...

314,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I have been giving thoughts if I should still write about Avengers: Endgame. My brain is just blacked out. I cannot think of anything. Maybe because the movie left me broken after seeing it. And I'm afraid that if I try to remember the scenes from the movie, I might end up crying.I felt sad after watching Infinity War, but Endgame just rips your heart out.I was very silent after the movie. I went straight home after watching it. I can't handle it. I just watched the most anticipated movie of 2019 and the excitement and anticipation were replaced with too many emotions that is very impossible to contain. I thought I was ready to watch it, but I wasn't.I haven't written a review that doesn't contain spoilers, so I would like this to be different. And it's really hard to write without spoiling the movie if the very core of the movie is how we are attached to the characters all over these years. We have been rooting for them for too long and seeing the conclusion of the franchise is giving us mixed emotions. All good feelings, I assure you but as I mentioned too much to contain.I will watch it again, not to be broken again, but because this movie might be our last connection to the characters we ever love. (You'll know when you see the movie.)I'm sending this warning to all MCU fans who haven't seen it. Be very ready for every possible and impossible thing that might happen because this movie will give you an emotional blow. You will clap. You will jump. You will shout. You will cheer. You will cry. And heck, you will weep. I know I did. #AvengersEndgame #EndgameReview"

317,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"After seeing all the 22 movies and some of them even twice I have to say that the last movie of the MCU was perfectly balanced in every aspect. Full of passion, drama, funny scenes, action... it has it all! An almost flawless scenario that left me stumbled by its depth and ode in logike. This scenario along with the coordination of the Russo Brothers (another proof that brotherhood collaboration excels) truly inspired all actors involved for a great performance. All these years of participations in different movies also enable them all to surpass themselves in acting. That's the success on the MCU in my opinion along with a clearly anthropocentric approach to the character of its heroes .Of course with such an amount of actors playing there will have been some cliques projected more during the film, but their unification under one roof was excellent. Thumbs up also for actor's discretion on leaks on the script.To be honest after I watched with much anticipation Avengers Infinity War in which I have to say I expected more in terms of fights among characters like in the comic books (maybe I was biased due to the numerous action-based trailers), I was prepared for a good but not special endgame. But on the contrary as Red Skull would say ""We all think we were prepared.. we were all wrong!""A mind elevation for children, a new dimension of sentimental fulfillment for adults.. Best entertaining three hours I had in years! I just wish we had even some more! Especially in the movie's action scenes, I had such goosebumps only from classic trilogy like Wachowski Bros Matrix or in the Star Wars clone war.Must SEE 10/10."
318,"May 19, 2019",6,"Let's get this straight from the start: Infinity War is far more entertaining and a better film overall.Endgame is a nice way to send off the storyline with a fan service movie, giving some nice nostalgia for the previous Marvel films in the series and the characters we've come to know and love, but there are many problems with the overall plot and film itself.It would take quite a while to go in to it in too much detail, but to put it simply: Infinity War was also a long movie, but never felt long. I check my watch after what turned out to be 1 hour of Endgame and couldn't believe there was still another 2 hours to go.It's possible I'd hyped it up to myself too much beforehand, but even then, plot points would have annoyed me regardless. I'd say the overall feelings afterwards were: nostalgic, sad (I admit to some tears), happy, ""it was alright""... but ultimately a little disappointing and frustrating."

322,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Avengers endgame is kind of a ""sweet gift"" from marvel studios to all marvel fans around the world who have been faithful in terms of following the franchise since it was released first on 2008.10 years of workhard, never dissapointing. Avengers endgame is a kind of a ""indirect communication"" between the director and the fans, on how thankful they are for having them.Avengers endgame, undoubtly, is a work made by heart."
323,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Just go watch it I promise you won't regret itP.S. don't wait for the after credits scene there are none
324,"May 11, 2019",7,"I've grown up with the MCU with Iron Man coming out when I was 5 years old. I love this series and it's sad that the main saga is over but I expected a bit more. I gave Infinity War a 9/10 because of its amazing pace, fun characters and unexpected gut-wrenching ending, but this film has sluggish and inconsistent pacing, ruined character arcs (like Hulk as in IW he was afraid to even show himself but now they sorted everything out... Off screen), and a very predictable story and ending. I'm not even joking when I say that (even though my prediction was slightly different) my prediction to the film was extremely accurate to the films events.To conclude, I watched Infinity War 3 times in cinemas and who knows how many times on Blu-Ray, but I've only seen Endgame once and have no intention of seeing it again anytime soon: I liked it, but was overall disappointed."
325,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"This is not just movie, it's beyond movie. It's the one movie that doesn't required any review, recommendations or feedback. Best comic book movie ever. MASTERPIECE! #endgame #dontspoiltheendgame"
326,"Apr 27, 2019",10,What a great entertainer. One of the finest movies of recent times. Everyone thought storyline will be predictable. But it actually isn't. We witnessed so twist and turn in the movie. It was emotional and chances are that you will leave the theatre crying and heartbroken. Overall I think it's a great farewell to avengers. Thank you MCU for another masterpiece. I give 10/10 to this last Avenger movie. Go and watch this epic movie.
327,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Im not gonna spoil this. Full of emotions out there... sacrifice... love ... and action..❤
328,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"10 years, 22 movies has come to an end.This movie provides laughter tears and joy. It is the perfect ending for most of the characters and a New beginning for Some. If this movie doesnt get an award im stumped.Thanks for making this movie. And i am hopefull for the future of the MCU."
329,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"If you're a follower of the MCU like myself then you don't need to read any reviews to convince you to watch this movie, it's the culmination of years of movies and a must see for fans. It's Filled with epic, emotional, sad and funny moments with tons of details for those who have been following all the previous movies, It's what you'd expect from a movie with this caliber and more. I'm excited to see what the future holds for MCU and if it's going on with the same execution as this one then i'll be really satisfied."
330,"May 6, 2019",6,"IW was way better, this movie did not deliver, I actually even preferred Capt Marvel."
331,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Don't even try to except anything when you go to see the movie because even if you will try super hard, there is no way you can guess what will happen. The movie has an amazing story, twists, fight scenes, and some really emotional scenes too. It will give you everything you want to it to show you and even more. So trust me, Do not waist and go watch this beautiful movie when you have a chance to."
332,"Jul 29, 2019",7,"Say goodbye to any semblance of a plot which is tied to character. This is not it. Bad writing and concept, probably born of corporate and committee-led ""creation teams"" has made these movies not into entertainment but just more fan service. When outrageous plot developments have no consequences because they can just be ""undone"" with time travel, the writers have no incentive to connect characters to decisions which permanently affect plot. The result is an empty but spectacular show full of glitter, movement, and noise. This is fine if that's what you wanted to see, but this is not a film about characters, despite its shallow attempts to bring it in for this or that moment (again, reversing all those character traits at a moments notice when it's convenient). It's disturbing to see fans rating this with 10's and ""best film ever"". One wonders if any kind of story is necessary at all to get the ""Wow"" reaction. Still, I applaud the filmmaker's efforts to add enough time to spotlight some of the characters, even if those efforts are in the end, transitory and a character mirage, to be forgotten, so that the big reset can take place. In this at least it is true to comics, and in that sense, this is a typical bit of bad comic plotting converted into film, so if praise is deserved for being true to mediocrity, at least they earned their 10/10 in that respect. Marvel movies are to film what Professional Wrestling is to the Olympics -- corrupt, shallow, and based on cheap thrills -- and worth watching only if that's what you came to see."
333,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"The movie left me shocked, and astonished. Great movie, Best Marvel movie by a long shot. Wow, just Wow."
334,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Just very satisfied, very entertained, and very much wanting to see it again and again! Also, very happy to have been a part of the whole saga and very much wanting to share this experience with our grandkid. What a ride!"
335,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"After watching Infinity War, I could not wait for this one. But as the time passed, I felt that End Game would not surpass Infinity War's awesomeness. But now that I have watched it, my advice to everyone is keep your expectations as high as possible, and still it would surpass all your expectations. It truly justifies all the 22 movies and please watch them all before watching this one. Stay away from spoilers. You will laugh and definitely cry multiple times."
336,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"I don't wanna spoil anything but god damn ..this was amazing, funny, dramatic, sad, action packed...everything about it was just perfect.. The 3 hours went by like they were nothing. And im gonna go watch it again on Friday because this was a emotion roller coaster and i need more of if."
337,"Apr 25, 2019",10,You didn't saw that coming. If you don't leave the theater crying there is something really wrong with you
338,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"The movie seems to be dragged. If you're going in with an expectation that it will contain lots of action, you'll be disappointed. Few major characters have been watered down in significance as well. Overall decent movie, but won't watch it again. If you're going in with an expectation of ""Dark Knight, Interstellar, Inception, Logan"" level movie, then don't. You'll end up disappointed."
339,"Apr 24, 2019",10,This movie is beyond the expectation. I think this statement is enough to get an idea without any spoilers that how is the movie.
340,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"Unpopular opinion. there are too many plot holes, not an epic movie opposed to what fanboys think. Entertaining but slow paced.I watched IW thrice but wouldn't like to see endgame again."
341,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"There really are no words that anyone can use to describe this film. But if I had to put it into one word, it would be ""Spoilers"". See it if you haven't."
342,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Without second thoughts I would say that it wad the most impressive work for Marvel.. makes you feel sad, happy, excited and thrilled to the max all in one movie"
343,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I laughed so loud I clapped with so much force and I cried so hard the movie exceeds every expectation and is the perfect culmination of the entire marvel cinematic universeAvoid spoilers as all costs !
344,"May 25, 2019",10,The best superheroes movie a end of era for marvel was very good
345,"May 5, 2019",6,Infinity War was much better. This movie was all over the place and lazy. They reduced Thor and Hulk to an absolute joke.
346,"Apr 30, 2019",2,All over the place & all in all very dissapointing - even some of marvel characters have morphed into embarrassing caricatures. Is it the writers fault or have some of the actors got a bit too much influence? ..... I don't get what planet anyone who gives thos film 5/10 is living on let alone all the 9/10 and 10/10 rating ... The mind boggles ....
347,"Jul 31, 2019",10,"To all the people who rated this 1 or 2 stars...WHAT MOVIE did you watch? Just to hear Cap say ""Avengers Assemble"" alone makes this epic...remember the question Mr. Hand asked his class when so many failed the test? This is a great film, action, humor, emotion...all on display..."
348,"Apr 24, 2019",10,The best MCU movie i've ever seen. And I could not control my sobbing during certain scenes which I am not going to spoil it here just for you guys. You all have to see this!!!!!!! A must watch.
349,"Aug 14, 2019",10,"I appreciate many desperate people want to seem ""edgy"" or ""alternative"" by defining themselves as ""different"" but really, you come off as nothing more than the representation of inadequacy. I'm not suggesting you need to love this movie or that you can't find fault, but what this and it's predecessor, Infinity War, achieved; not only in cinema, but storytelling as a whole, is laudable. This is not a stand-alone movie and requires some foreknowledge, but it's an accomplished endgame of a movie arc of over 10 years unlike any other in movie history"
350,"Apr 24, 2019",10,What a great movie!! You know nothing until the end! Such a masterpiece!!
351,"May 7, 2019",9,Robert Downey JR needs an Oscar. Fantastic performance
352,"May 4, 2019",7,"All has been said, fanboys stop overrating your S***"
353,"Jul 1, 2019",1,"I dont see why people think its that great. We already know whats gonna happen. They just copy it from the comics. You want a good superhero movie. Make the movie first, then the comic book. It will save time and money."
354,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Sobbed. So much to take in. No words. Gonna watch it a millionth time more these few weeks.
355,"Apr 27, 2019",10,A movie which was not expected but a movie which was truly deserved.
356,"May 7, 2019",10,Just Awesome. An epic conclusion of an epic storyline. Makes you both happy and sad. One of the best superhero movies ever.
357,"Apr 30, 2019",10,Just how much time we need to see a movie like this again
358,"Apr 29, 2019",10,For a 3hr film it flies by. Ties up the MCU nicely and the best film I have seen in a while. Highly recommend
359,"Apr 30, 2019",6,"Mediocre Revamp of old stuff, waste of time, okay ending."
360,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This film is the conclusion of the infinity saga series containing all 22 films for the past 10 years. Plotwise is great. It's a great storytelling. Few scenes are weird but acceptable. Marry Sue? Very few. OP? Just very few. It's reasonable and fun to watch every minutes. Nebula's arc is good and the actress is great. Every 6 main character's arcs including Ant-man are decent. There are shocks and twists but reasonable also. Characters from the past return and add very good additional contexts. The screenwriters, directors and producers made a good job. The CGI is good and realistic. The acting is world class. Many characters but they lifts up each other in the good way. Every actors are great. I can see myself go back to watch it ten times, and I can do this all day. Enjoy :) I actually rate this movie 9.6/10, but lean towards 10."
361,"Aug 10, 2021",6,"Dragged out too much, 15 min action on a 3 hour superhero movie with plot holes."
362,"May 23, 2019",1,My 9 year old after 30 mins of watching asked me if we were in the right theater. It went worse from there.
363,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"It really what we can call, the best end to the avengers. The visual effects are wonderful with lots of laughter and emotional scenes. The 3d 4dx worth it."
364,"May 7, 2019",10,"I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even ""copied"" or ""homaged"" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?Yes the first hour of the movie is ""slow"", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of courseEdit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is ""technically sound"" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway. Popcorn (or Nachos or whatever you prefer) to perfection"
365,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"It has taken many years and lots of work to build up to this amazing movie. This completely satisfied and exceeded my expectations for how I hoped they would pull this all off. I have been a huge fan of the movies leading up to this and this did it all justice. All the hidden ""Easter eggs"" from the other installments have been hinting towards this and I can't believe how big this has all gotten over the years. I was glad to see that even though this movie had a very serious fight at hand that there was still some classic Marvel comedy that made for some very funny moments. There was laughter, tears, and cheers through this movie. It was an emotional roller coaster that I already plan on going to again soon in theaters. It is a must see for those who have already been fans of the MCU and if you haven't followed it to this point this movie won't make sense or mean much to you so go back and watch the other movies. It is all worth it."
366,"Apr 24, 2019",10,There are so many surprises and twists in this film. I believe it's really a perfect ending for the first decade of MCU!! Couldn't be better!!
367,"Apr 29, 2019",6,"Infinity war was a tough act to follow; ultimately nothing was likely to be sufficient as a closing act. Disregarding plot holes, which don't really matter to much in an action film, there are a few aspects which brought the film low.The movie is very self-indulgent with fan service. A little is fine, but it's a massive component in this movie.There's Ragnarok-level humour, which will undoubtedly be to the tastes of many - just not mine.The film is very slow to get off the ground. That's fine as long as there is some real substance, but it's lacking.Characters have been handicapped in order to curb the power creep, where as others are momentarily escalated in ability. This is not uncommon, but very noticeable in this flick due to the volume.Of course, you're going to see it regardless; don't go in sky-high expectations and you'll probably have a good time."
368,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"I did not expect to see in my life such a faithful rendition of my childhood heroes from the comics to the big screen ... the emotions was huge ... the only reason I kept and did not cry in the cinema was because I was shy not to see me ... . From Athens Greece Thank you STAN LEE for filling my childhood with those fantastic stories and heroes ,also Russo and marvel because you have respected our comic heroes on the big screen ... my only sadness is that we could not see avengers together with XMEN- fantastic four -Daredevil in the same movie, but you can not have it all at life"
369,"May 5, 2019",7,"Well, it finally happened: I got emotional during a Marvel movie. Sorry, not sorry. This film truly was a fitting conclusion to a decade of MCU films. While it was a classic action sequel, it was also filled with surprises, homages, laughs, and emotional moments. Unfortunately, that's a LOT to accomplish in one movie (hence the 3 hour runtime). Fortunately, almost all of it worked. They wanted to bring 22 movies to an epic climax...mission accomplished. I'm not sure that I would put this one alongside the best stand alone MCU chapters (Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Ragnarok, Iron Man, etc.), but it somehow pulled all those movies together in a pretty magical way. I complain a lot about the comic book-ification of film, but I can also recognize the accomplishment that is the MCU."
370,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I didn't think this could surpass Infinity War but the Russo Brothers did it. Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame managed to do it. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and I'll go so far as to say, maybe even the absolute pinnacle of the Marvel franchise. It's both hilarious and emotionally engaging (there were people crying at my theatre including me). And while it's a lot more character focused than Infinity War, as it should be considering this is the final hurrah for many of the original Avengers, that doesn't mean it's lacking In terms of visuals. The film is an absolute spectacle to behold, it easily tops Infinity War's action sequences in my opinion and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated.10/10 best Marvel movie in my opinion. It's honestly hard for me to see how they'll ever be able to top this one."
371,"Apr 26, 2019",10,They landed the plane. You cannot do a better job of ending a gigantic story. Kudos to the Russo brothers and the entire cast.
372,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Amazing movie, satisfies every question possible! It made me cry 😥😥 10/10"
373,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Just came from a midnight screening , what a movie ! It will leave with every emotion ! Thank you MCU for this franchise !"
374,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"This by far the best marvel movie I have ever watched, the emotions are strong, the battle was amazing, and when I watched it, i was shaking so much, and I couldn't breathe cuz of the fight scenes, and we lost some character's I won't say, but I cried!!, this movie is s must watch am telling you, it well be the best 3 hour and 2 mins of your life!"
375,"Apr 30, 2019",6,"I'm a HUGE Marvel fan and have been so excited for this movie, and to be honest, I'm disappointed. It was a decent movie, and I was invested in the story, but it was no where near my expectations.This movie was way too over hyped and in my opinion, messy. Humor was good, emotion was there (at the end), and concept was cool. But, ruined certain character arcs, was poorly executed, and was not worth the hype I gave it before seeing it.There were moments that made me very emotional, laugh, and made me jump with excitement which is all a plus. I came out of the theater crying a mix of happy and sad tears, but the more I think about it, there were so many flaws (mostly to do with character arcs). It was so fast paced with the characters and ruined the genuine connection we built with them in past movies. It's almost like they're completely different people. All in all, it was an ending we won't forget... even though it kind of flopped."
376,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"NO SPOILERS First off, the timeline in this movie is flawless. The absolute best, most coherent and consistent time travel use in any movie. The complaints in these reviews completely misunderstood how it worked.Second, the other complaint is Thor. Was he weaker? Yeah. Was I disappointed? Yeah, but it follows the progression of his character. He lost his whole family, swore revenge, almost saved the day and missed it by a foot. His demise into self loathing makes perfect sense and allows other characters to shine in battles. Thor tends to be overpowered so this leveled the playing field.Third, the pacing is slow and ponderous. But it asks you to follow the characters and their emotions and reactions to the snap. The slow pace allows the characterization to shine and not be overblown by tedious fighting like some scenes in Infinity War.Overall, I don't get people's desire for overpowered characters with aimless action scenes. Endgame does a great job creating small moments for personality and giving everyone a chance to shine in battle."
377,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Man oh man what a movie ! cant believe im alive to witness this i cant say much cause that would spoil the movie if i did all im gonna say is that everyone is in a for a roller coaster of emotions and just plain epicness! You will be mindblown it's indescribable how good this movie is !!!!!
378,"Dec 19, 2019",6,"Not being a Marvel-fan (nor DC by the way, which seems to be important to the fans) I liked it's direct prequel better. It's an ok movie really, but it had no surprises in it for me."
379,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"Breathtaking. Endgame raises the bar so high. The emotion, comedy and action all combined to produce a movie of epic proportions that probably won't be matched for many years to come! The best MCU movie. Easily one of my all time Top 5 favs."
380,"Aug 1, 2019",1,"Horrible, wrapping things up for the sake of wrapping things up. Random stuff thrown together with no meaning or story."
381,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Marvel best movie ever .. mind blowing ,great action must match.."
382,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Best Superhero Movie Ever You Will Cry, Laugh, And In The End Of The Movie You Will Be Shocked.You Must Watch It"
383,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Absolutely loved the Endgame. A perfect and a satisfying end to an epic saga. It exceeds your highest expectations with too many pleasant surprises. An experience you will remember forever. The final hour of the movies is a perfect masterpiece filled with goosebumps, excitement tears. A new benchmark has been set for the upcoming superhero movies."
384,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Love u three thousand times This movie is truly an epic masterpiece that gives the audience one hell of a ride. Thank u Marvel Studio. Thank u, Russo brothers. Still can't believe this is the end of the original members."
385,"Apr 24, 2019",10,So as we know this is the last part of avengers series and for me after this no entertainment is left
386,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"A movie bigger than this has never been made or attempted. Critics who do not appreciate the movie or say its 'just another superhero movie' take this movie alone. This is NOT a standalone movie, its a closing to a spectacular franchise and it was satisfying on so many levels, I cant even explain. There were so many moments in the movie that made one appreciate the depth of character, backstory,human bonding, sacrifice and ofcourse comedy and action, that I cannot even point them out even if I wanted to.To enjoy the movie, at least watch most of the MCU movies. This is the movie of the decade and you WILL ENJOY THIS"
387,"Apr 26, 2019",3,"My friend, who I'd taken for the movie, fell asleep during the show. Seriously.The first hour or so of the movie will do that to you. Unless you are a fanatic fan of The Avengers. Maybe even then. I am and I was checking messages on my phone almost throughout.Sad."
388,"Apr 28, 2019",9,"I'll start by saying before Infinity War, I always thought that most Marvel films were a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me, they were all enjoyable, however the thing they so drastically lacked was a strong baddie. My issue with the first Avengers was Loki being so non threatening, and everyone I talk to about this seems to agree, however the breakthrough at the time was just to have all their heroes on screen together. You then had Avengers Age of Ultron, which had the baddie being a creation of Tony Stark, which I found unexciting, despite it being a fun watch. The two impressive Captain America sequels, the third of which had our heroes fighting against each other, again something I found to be a little underwhelming.Then came Infinity War, which for me totally raised the bar, and properly introduced one of the most threatening, and in my opinion Iconic baddies we have seen on the screen since Nolans Bane in TDKR. I was extremely dissapointed to not see more people dressed up as the mad titan last Halloween (no shortage of Harley Quinns and Jokers still). Infinity War ended with what is unquestionably the greatest shock in superhero film history, which then set up what promised to be a fascinating follow up.This film did not disappoint, and even if you are not a fan of superhero movies in general, I would strongly urge any film fan to at least watch both Infinity War and Endgame both. I am certain even the most hard nosed film critic (the type that boo every film at Cannes) can appreciate the quality of film-making on display here.I have seem some passionate YouTubers making videos about plot-holes being uncovered throughout this film, however given the direction the story took, I can imagine the difficulty the filmmakers had weaving this all together, and I am confident they did the best they could. Essential viewing."
389,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This movie will make u laugh , goose bumps and cry. The plot and the climax is insane. Good jobb Russo brothers for making us feel this way. What a perfect way to end an era. #hatsoff"
390,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"Wow , first time to stay 3 hours long in the cinema . It's quite an experience in IMAX with laser . Movie is alright , just like what i expected . But 50 USD worth ticket per one is insane !"
391,"Jul 17, 2019",10,For me Endgame was emotional saga and the journey of our generation came to and end and yes it was not action packed as Infinity War but I feel every violence comes to and end with piece and the ENDGAME could not have better journey then to have established the storyline the way they did.
392,"Jul 15, 2019",10,"This movie is a complete masterpiece! It is excellently acted, directed, and animated. It is an amazing payoff of all the previous marvel movies coming together."
393,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Gonna keep it simple here.. The movie is awesome.. Some people may say the movie got plotholes here and there but no.. The plotholes are negligible.. And all make senses. Better than Infinity Wars.. And i don't know what future lies ahead after the ending of Endgame. Would it be better with new line? I hope so.. But this movie really sum up all the hard work of 11 years of MCU. Thank You RDJ for starting all of this.
394,"Jul 24, 2019",10,"Though it has been repeated time and time again, it is still quite insane to think about an end to 11 years and 22 movies. A cinematic universe that for quite a few of us, we have grown up with. A universe that despite all the bad that may have gone on in one's life or in the world, we could always look forward to one day out of the year where we could escape that and enjoy 2 hours of watching our childhood heroes kick butt on the silver screen. A cinematic universe, that I quite frankly thought was impossible to successfully conclude, until the Russo Brothers proved me wrong. Any way you slice it, Avengers Endgame should go down as one of the toughest movies to write. Bringing a true and satisfying ending to 11 years of stories in a universe where the death is never truly accepted, the cast size seems never-ending, and an overabundance of story arcs could drive any writer insane should prove a near impossible task. Yet here we are as smart, conscious decisions are made throughout the movie. The reduced team size allows for a focus both character and story wise that makes it a movie easy to follow (for the most part) despite still being among the most ambitious Marvel movies. Surprise callbacks and fan-service moments act like a Greatest Hits album giving fans a true appreciation for the greatness of the Infinity Saga. Despite the temptation to just rely on these callbacks, where the film truly shines like any other Marvel movie is with its characters. Through the course of the 4,5, and 6 movies the Original Six Avengers have appeared in, several decisions have been made that not only affected each character but changed their overall perspectives. The Russo Brothers dedication to these characters is seen in the masterfully crafted scenes that continue or conclude the appropriate arcs. All while still producing shots, scenes, and moments that created the best cinematic experience I have ever had. To put it simply, for 3 hours I simply got to be a 10-year-old cheering, laughing, and crying with the heroes that I have grown up with, idolized, and loved for my whole life. For that I thank the entire Marvel family!"
395,"Jul 24, 2019",3,"A tremendous production, with lame script, very obvious and almost boring time line, I hardly kept my eyes open to watch it to the end. The movie was also too long for the poor content. They could have told that sorry in 1,5 hours. Oh my God... and Thor... seriously? Is it a joke? And captain America holding his hammer... that finally destroyed the image of the great Thor. Pity!"
396,"Oct 16, 2019",10,"A fitting end to a 22 movie story. It is not a full blown action packed Avengers movie, but what it does, and it does it very well, is wrap up everything in close to 3 hours with respect to everything that's gone before it. No spoilers here, but you'll enjoy the action, laugh at the humour and it will (probably) make you sad in parts. Loved the last couple of scenes especially. It's unusual to be able to watch 2 excellent films in 1 week (Joker being the other)."
397,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I'm sorry, i only got 10/10.. if i could, i'll give you 11/10. :) The very best way to ending your Infinity Saga.."
398,"May 3, 2019",8,"I agree with many other reviews in that this Avengers is over hyped. However, this movie IS STILL REALLY GOOD. I think a lot of people are giving it bad reviews because people had too high of expectations. Infinty War was a lot more action-packed and became a legendary film partly because Thanos's victory had such a large ""wow factor"" to it. In terms of pure enjoyment, infinity war takes the cake. However, the plot to endgame is really good and the action scenes are still pretty amazing.Honestly, my main disappointment with this movie is what they did to Thor's character. Thor was an amazing character in IW but in endgame he is kind of pathetic, DESPITE becoming one of the most powerful avengers by the end of IW. Personally, I wish they had found a better way to use Thor's character in this movie."
399,"Mar 22, 2024",10,"Avengers: Endgame is the finale to a decade-long journey of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It brings together many heroes from other movies to fight a big battle against Thanos, a very strong enemy. This movie continues the story from Avengers: Infinity War, where half of all living things disappeared.The movie is like a wild ride with lots of different feelings. There are exciting fight scenes, sad farewells, and funny surprises. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, made a story that finishes up all the earlier stories and also shows respect to all the movies that came before. The actors do a great job, especially Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America.Endgame is a special movie for the fans who love these heroes and their adventures. It's about being brave, doing hard things for others, and working together. The fight scenes are amazing to watch, and the special effects are really good.Avengers: Endgame is a great ending to a story that has made superhero movies very popular. It's a movie that finishes the story in a way that will make you remember it for a long time. It's a must-see movie for people who love super hero movies."
400,"Jun 25, 2019",10,Literally amazing in every way. You've read all the reviews. And you're living under a rock if you haven't seen it yet.JUST GO SEE IT!
401,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"It's a fine action movie for one time, jokes are good too. However, it lacks something that Infinity War had. As anyone else I've been waiting for the greatest hit the entire year. It's sad to admit but I left the theater with a feeling of disatisfaction."
402,"May 3, 2019",8,"They did such a great job with infinity War that Endgame wasn't able to deliver on the same level with the added pressure of being the grand finale. Part of the problem I think was that the story was developed to such a large-scale that was hard not to be so episodic, although it probably could have been done a lot better without losing the pacing with long, drawn out and sometimes awkward scenes.Some of the scenes felt like the writers didn't know which direction to go with characters and the direction they chose was not quite right. Endgame lacked a lot of the slick and fun banter that made the characters shine in previous movies. The writers had their moments but a lot of it could be pretty cringe-worthy at times.I get that everyone needed therapy after Infinity War but it felt a little too depressing for too long. All in all end game was a a good movie and it's evident that that Disney tried to put everything but the kitchen sink in this movie to please the fans which is appreciated. But I would have loved to have seen them spend more time crafting and polishing this into the Crown Jewel it's supposed to be rather than an uncut diamond."
403,"Jun 7, 2019",6,"Actually, I can't understand why that many people enjoyed this movie so much. It's boring, illogical, predictable etc. Just an average movie about superheroes. The first part was much better in any aspect.Perhaps it's worth watching one time, but no more."
404,"Apr 30, 2019",2,"This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Visuals, the actresses and actors, and plot. Everything linked up. I love this film and would recommend it to anyone."
405,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"We have laughed, cried and rejoiced during the whole journey of 22 movies and have lived through them. It have now become a part of us and I just hope that our future generations can understand and feel the things which we understood at times and felt !!!Here's to Us who witness the end of an ERA !!!"
406,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"What is there to say about the ending to a film series that defined an entire new chapter of Hollywood? It's difficult to process everything that happens in Endgame, but that's to be expected from a film of this scale. It's enthralling and unforgettable - get ready to feel EVERY emotion!"
407,"Feb 12, 2020",9,"This movie was genious for some reason,less action i know.but at the end this movie was a masterpiece on many ways,ill be waiting for more marvel movies for now."
408,"Jul 16, 2019",10,"What a monumental movie & wonderful closure for a 11yrs Odyssey that is gonna be remembered as a legendary achievement on a cinematic standpoint. It is a magnificent love letter to all these emblematic characters & for us all, passionate fans of these universes."
409,"May 5, 2019",9,Film which triggered a lot of emotion. Fantastic end to the franchise.
410,"May 9, 2019",6,I was slightly underwhelmed by the movie and I didn't cry at the ending at all. There was far too much sickly sweet scenes for my liking.The time travel bit left more questions than answers for me. The 2nd click mmmmI won't be going to see anymore Marvel movies apart from maybe Black Panther as I'm done
411,"Jul 11, 2020",10,"(Before starting reading remember: this is MY opinion and how I felt by watching this movie. If you didn't enjoy it...I am sorry for you.)I will never be so hyped again for a movie in general. This is the perfect conclusion for a 10 years old saga. It closes the arches of the main characters and opens some for the new ones. The battle scenes are awesome, the themes too, perfect character narration and development. Maybe the plot is a little bit simple and predictable, but sometimes you don't need a complex one to do a perfect movie. You can't judge a movie only by one aspect of itself. Infinity war was the ACTION part, endgame was the FEELINGS part. Yes, infinity war was better, but this movie also has its moments.One of the best experiences I had in a theater, we cried, we laughed, we smiled. almost PERFECTION."
412,"May 12, 2019",3,Don't believe the reviews. I suspect it's people paid to do positive reviews. Either that or I saw a different movie! Nothing much happens for 2 hours. There was no plot to speak of and i could have written better dialogue! The soundtrack is the best thing about it seriously
413,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"It was an epic, funny & emotional conclusion to the 11 years of the MCU. It's probably one of the most 'comic booky' film next to Spider Verse."
414,"May 20, 2019",10,This is how you to end a series an epic ending perfect I cried so much
415,"Sep 13, 2024",10,"Literally year and years and film after film, lead to this. It's a masterclass in how pull all the strings together. The brain power, energy and commitment to bring this to bear is incredible. The infinity saga ended in a way that made me feel...a lot. Not exactly insightful. I'm sure the are people who also find it hard to express how they felt. Fans have invested time and energy in the years leading up to 'endgame'. To some people this saga has been just a bunch of superhero films. In reality it means so much more for so many people. Endgame, brings a close to an era of movies that had meaning, It does so perfectly. As I'm typing this in autumn 2024, I've seen how Marvel has tried to evolve following endgame. There are some and misses but I'm continuing to watch."
416,"May 5, 2019",10,"Avengers Endgame is a masterpiece! The Russo brothers have nailed this epic conclusion to the Infinity Saga. This movie exceeded all of my expectations and so much more... I'm really happy with the how to Russo brothers handled the aftermath of the decimation and how the remaining avengers move on from this devastating event.Overall, the movie had amazing visual effects, epic soundtracks, amazing cast and this movie is a must-watch for all marvel fans..Loved every second of the movie and give it a 10/10Thank you Marvel, the Russo brothers, the cast and the crew of endgame for making this movie my favourite comic book movie ever!"
417,"Apr 27, 2019",9,Part 1 of the 2 final movies was perfect. Character development was still going forward. Endgame is nothing but a screen full of the characters we have come to know and love. It tried to tell too much so what we ended up with was clips and a lot of jumping around. It was like a movie made up of movie preview clips. What a let down after all these years.
418,"May 15, 2020",10,"Endgame is a fan based movie, only MCU fans gonna like it. This movie is the greatest superhero fantasy movie, a perfect ending for generation. There is lots of goosebumps moments, lots of oh my God moments, wtf moments. Especially the last 30 minutes you will see the greatest Cinematic war,some upsets for fans. Avengers endgame will be remembered as one of the greatest movie."
419,"Jan 29, 2022",7,"The finale of the lengthy series featuring a constellation of Marvel's luminaries, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a watchable superhero flick that merges real life interactions and explosive fantasy. Featuring A-List stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk and Black Widow respectively the film finds our heroes in the eternal tale of the battle between good and evil and some stones. Decent acting with simple but adequate special effects help carry the view. The biggest snag of the whole enterprise is its length. Clocking in at three hours the span strains an already shaky script and the mature viewer's patience. Perhaps I've long outgrown Fantasy movies and seeing full grown men and women in skimpy outfits playing cartoon characters challenged belief and the overall silliness of it can't be shaken off. Maybe it's not just me; the bored, going through the motions look of the actors especially at the start of the film seems to mirror this. The thought of having to wear those tight stretchy outfits for the umpteenth time and having to memorize and utter those prepubescent lines were too much despite the hefty paycheck. A massive hit despite all of that, I still remember the loooooong lines in the cinemas to watch this and I guess the masses are basically dorks who'll embrace fantasies on the big screen to forget themselves and their lives. This is one to burn time with the kiddos and make you appreciate your soda and popcorn more."
420,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"As of now, after about 100K reviews the average user rating for Avengers: Endgame sits at 9.2. Infinity War, after about 620K, has an 8.5. I like where this assessment stands and hope it doesn't change much, as more user ratings flood in.I point this out for all the negative reviews citing how Infinity War was far superior to Endgame and that Endgame was such garbage and flawed. This is without a doubt a case of the criticisms saying much more about the critic than what they are saying about the film. Perhaps their own disposition and attitudes prevent them from a positive perception. They are certainly entitled to their pretentiousness and to feel cheated, but their petulance is their OWN responsibility. Much to the chagrin of this minority, the majority has not only embraced what Endgame is, but for the time being placed it above Infinity War.I say this because I tire of the arrogance and contempt in people that behave as though they could have written or produced a better result than what they paid to see. Many of those that love to review or critique, think it en vogue or trendy to be incredulous, negative, or never be satisfied.I'm happy to see that the majority of viewers were satisfied and more than content with Avengers: Endgame. IMO, complaining and rating the film sub par requires a great amount of cynicism and disenchantment. IMO, if you allow plot holes or whatever other discrepancies found in the film, to ruin it or leave you sour and disappointed, then you probably tend to create your own misery in life in life anyway.There's nothing wrong with having a personal opinion or particular disposition. I do however think it important to put disillusionment and negativity in its proper place, to achieve objective perspective. So again, according to imdb user review, Infinity War is at 8.5 and Endgame is at 9.2 and holding. I'll check back on the consensus in a few months after further reviews."
421,"May 5, 2019",2,"It is overrated movie - and not in the same level as infinity war. I think the two movies could have been merged into one 3 hrs movie and spare us the hype of 13 years old fans all over the world.It is not worth it.Most of the parts are slow paced and dull, and the action sequences are not new or even surprising.Full of cinematic cliches."
422,"May 22, 2019",10,"I'm big fan of marvel, and I see all movie comics books and this is a best movie in the world not only comics , in all movies."
423,"May 20, 2019",10,Nothing to say more than that this movie will always be the greatest of all time.
424,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"No spoilers here. 22 movies, 11 years, and multiple story arcs to tie together. A MASSIVE and record breaking task. Not only that, but I was expecting a lot and got MORE than what I expected. Infinity war was incomplete (on purpose). Unfortunately it just didn't feel like a complete story. This movie is a complete story in and of itself, and it ties in well. More action, more acting, good humor, and TIME TRAVEL!! Also, no credit scenes. This is the end of the current Avengers saga as we know it. Expect teasers for the next team, but don't expect any hints of the next saga's story."
425,"Jul 10, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame (2019) BROKE MY SCALE 20/10""A finale so masterfully constructed, Avengers: Endgame proves to us that a finale WILL do whatever it takes to treat the fans with an emotionally moving, action-packed masterpiece.""I am just blown away by how well Endgame does for itself. My expectations were stacked, and the film somehow managed to surpass those expectations. Like Infinity War, Endgame manages to strategically balance the humor with the seriousness of specific aspects, you'll either be laughing or crying, or both at certain points. The action still stands out as a fair product of entertainment, going to the extremity of any situation, no matter how impossible it may have seemed; taking risky moves to get the film's point across the table. Lastly, the characters are so well written in this, sometimes its just hard to believe that our original heroes conclude their stories in this tearjerking finale; it really is hard to say goodbye sometimes when we've grown on these characters since day one. I can even say that Thanos' character is basically given the upgrade in sociopathic motive, making him somewhat unpredictable just like the predecessor. The film does have its minimalistic flaws (like any other film) but I felt that these flaws are completely ineffective towards the the whole idea of what points the film intends to display.Verdict: Avengers: Endgame marks the end of an era that lasted 11 years. It concludes a story so fashionably well, its safe to say to bring the tissue and bring the applause, because there's no way in hell anyone was prepared for this epic finale. One more thing, I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in the making of Endgame (especially the Russo Brothers), and anyone who contributed to the build up to this conclusion we've all waited for. And a final thank you to the man himself, Stan Lee, for showing us that the real heroes are the fans because WE made it happen. May he rest in peace, thank you for reading folks."
426,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Just a superb example of beautiful story telling!3 hrs passes in the blink of an eye, although you come out feeling like you have been put through an emotion wringer. Incredibly well done, even down to the appropriate, satisfying but not ""happy"" ending...Just see it - no - just see ALL of the MCU movies :-)"
427,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Objectively, if this movie is produced by any other studio no matter in which country,it won't get a score of 10. But the thing is I can never be rational about MARVEL. Avengers:Endgame indeed give MARVEL's as well as my last 11 years a satisfying ending.This movie is a milestone in the film industry, I doubt if we'll be able to see another movie like this any time sooner, so I really suggest that people,especially MARVEL fans enjoy this movie to the fullest for the highly likely vaccany of this type of film in the next decade or even decades.In Avengers:Endgame, we waved goodbye to some of our favorite chracters and we may never see them in MCU again. But one thing I do know is that the examples these heroes set for us and their spirits will never die, and their successors will bring us more surprises.I will never forget the eleven years in which in grew up with MCU ,and I hope it'll always be with me in the future. As for MARVEL and all the superheroes that have left us ,love you 3000 times until eternity"
428,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"I hardly think anyone could fairly admit to disappointment after experiencing the sufficiently bombastic, tearful and wacky conclusion to a decade of Marvel content that delivers on every promise and gives (as others have stated before me) back to the fans in a very unique way.The entire movie is a spoiler. That said...there isn't a whole lot more TO say. If Infinity War was your cup of tea, Endgame is going to do everything you want it to... but not in the way you expect it to. Yes, there's a measure of predictability; but there's also plenty of surprises - a mix of both, really, which feels just about right.My feelings a few hours after seeing Endgame are as follows: Sad, a little depressed that some things will never be the same going forward. I know all good earthly things have an end - sometimes it's a little difficult to accept. In a way, the good ol' days are now officially ""old"". On the flip side of the coin, I'm a little exuberant about the possibilities opened up, the new concepts explored, and probably more than anything, the completely perfect fanfare that had the folks at my cinema cheering and applauding at every turn. In other words, I'm experiencing mixed emotions. Decipher my very cryptic notes as you will... but see Endgame for yourself. It's hardly something to be missed. And it's hardly something to be forgotten.Some people move on. But not us.Not us."
429,"Aug 7, 2019",3,"As much as we might miss some of the characters who died in Infinity war, this avengers movie was not necessary. The story ended perfectly in last movie. I feel that this was an effort to bring back lost characters for whom most of the little boys and girls cried for in last movie... and in doing so, making tons of mistakes and dynamics change that made it near unwatchable. As much as it upsets people, Thanos was always right. And this was just a sad attempt in making him the unreasonable bad guy... sad."
430,"May 5, 2019",10,No amount of words can explain this rollercoaster of emotions 😱😱😱😱😱😱
431,"Jul 22, 2019",10,"It worth the hype, the movie was simply amazing and it had a strong emotional impact, I was diving from laughing to tension and sadness, but after all it was a great movie! All the 1 star reviews are wired in my opinion, those people just throw away with hate without even watching the whole MCU or just because they didn t understand the hype."
432,"Mar 12, 2020",10,I don't believe on the people that have given this 1 star because this is one of the best mcu movie and the greatest movie in the world. I was the most anticipated movie of 2019. It is one of the best movie in the world.
433,"May 1, 2019",7,"Movie is full of action, but even for that I wait last 30 min when the movie Will be over, cause it didn't have hype to keep me exciting. Characters are great written. Some Characters as Thor and Hulk are much different that we been seen them before. Fight scenes and acting are better in Infinity war.For example:when Thor come in Wakanda in Infinity war. Story line is great, but have some gaps. In this movie Cap. American and Iron man are in front plan. In this movie Thor is so so different and almost act like a girl. This is to big turn over for such musculine and strongest character of all Avengers.on moment it looks like this is Cap America or Iron man movie. I expect much more after media advertising."
434,"May 4, 2019",10,"Russo brothers did an outstanding job. Every moment of the movie was great. Some scenes that are connected to first Iron man movie, previous Avengers movies and comics were so neat that it just makes you say ""WOW!!!"". Battle scenes are breathtaking. Ending is just perfect. Enjoy the movie and make sure to watch it couple more times."
435,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"One of the main reasons why this movie is only a 7 is because of the super high expectations and how excited I was for this. So for me it was kind of a let down but not just because of the hype. Personally the pacing was just God awful, and it's not because it's a little slow to start, but it's the massive amount of jumps the film takes. I can watch slow movies with a build up, but when everything changes so quickly and then goes back to slow repetitively it creates an frustrating feeling. The movie also has many unexplained plot holes, with most movies this is fine, but when you need to know the details (which are very important for marvel films) then it hits the plot a lot. I also feel like the movie tried too hard to be emotional. There was no need for the way it ended or the sad spots in between. Not to mention, the cgi on captain marvel looks great. Still a good better then average movie, but not the best ever."
436,"May 5, 2019",2,"The great thing about the Avengers-Franchise has always been this winning scheme:1. A range of very different characters like Thor, Spidey and Strange, clashing together in witty and funny dialogues that showcases just how different they are. Spidey cracking jokes about deep philosophic insights of Strange, while Thor asks about beer.2. Incredible fight scenes3. Both may be linked by a variety of different narrative elements, from film-noir/detective over comedy to splatter.It's an easy base recipe, that may be filled with any narrative strings, so long as they are intriguing.Problem with the Avengers movies and the finale in particular is:The winning scheme is NOT used and the narrative underlying is poor, at best.They picked parts of a variety of comics (like the ""Thor get's irresponsible and fat""-plot), which is ok and linked them very poorly together. It's a series of short plots, loosely tied together with no red line (other than ""Thanos is the Endboss"").Secondly, the acting is poor, apart from Iron Man of course! Even Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johanssen do a really bad job at depicting their character. The digitally animated raccoon is a highlight in terms of acting.There is only ONE AVENGER-TYPICAL FIGHTSCENE, which is great, but does not make up for the rest.Foot-Note: As a Non-American, the Glory-Halleluja-Murica focus on Cap is too much. If you're patriotic enough, you'll love it, of course."
437,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"A Malaysian reviewer here. Screening on the 24th April 2019 and All i can say it is a behemoth undertaking compiling 21 or so films, expanding over 11 years of MCU phase 1 and phase 2 universe. How the heck are they going to pull this off? Questions arise and questions being answered with a 3 hour long movie. Its a good solid 3 hour marvel movie.A good slow pace on the first part showing human vulnerability on superheroes. Even superheroes need emotional support from someone. Its is nice to see Hawkeye got some good character scene compared to his last/ previous involvement.Second part comes the built up whereby it is fun to see how they interact with previous marvel films. (note to those don't follow MCU universe) You really need to see few previous marvel films to understand further what i am talking about.The Third act is the final act whereby the brothers did a terrific job giving what fans wanted. An awesome (+/-)45 minutes battle that exceed my expectation. Crazy visual effect/ CGI . Such an eye candy to see on the big screen.All i can say this movie is well worth the 11 years of waiting and the screenwriters and directors did very well in showing off the maturity of marvel MCU films. It is like having all favorite songs and compile it as your greatest hits. This is how endgame felt like to me. It is just so freaking awesoommeeeeeeeeeee"
438,"Apr 28, 2019",8,"For the past 11 years MCU has been increasing their fan base across the globe with larger than life characters. Avengers : End Game: With the expectations sky high, the Russo brothers delivered a fitting finale to this franchise. What worked: 1. The emotions were very well connected with the audience. 2. Jaw dropping CGI and VFX. 3. The last battle.What could have been better: 1. Screenplay a bit slow. 2. The war sequence could have been a bit lengthier.Overall, this experience is for a life time and hence everyone should enjoy this wonder movie in IMAX"
439,"Jun 21, 2019",10,I liked this and the action it was so much action and I like the captain America part
440,"Jul 25, 2019",10,"Great closure, amazing movie. Just the right ending for a 22 movie saga."
441,"May 6, 2019",9,It can't get better than this. Best MCU and Marvel movie IMO.
442,"May 1, 2019",8,"Alot of things could have been done better. The whole film is based on a time-travel idea that Antman came up with and Antman doesn't get enough credit or time in the film. Hawkeye gets more time in the film! Who cares about Hawkeye?! Slow in parts. Reminds me of Avengers Assemble, most of the film is build up to a final, end of film battle. Much preferred Infinity Wars pace, energy and action-packedness. Infinity War made me so excited for Endgame. Endgame made me want to rewatch Infinity War."
443,"Sep 6, 2019",3,"Avengers: Endgame is not a good movie. In fact, even when you like the Avengers, there are far better options to watch than this one, for example Infinity War. Endgame has lot of boring and cringy scenes, you really need to force yourself to watch it without skipping parts of it. Especially the fact that these ""Superheroes"" are still crying every day after Thanos snap and cant build up a life again was annoying af."
444,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Best marvel movie ever, conclusion of the 21 marvel movies don't think much just go for it 😍😍💟💟"
445,"Oct 3, 2019",10,I seen this in the theaters and let me tell you this was the most mixed emotion movie ever this movie had me crying especially at the end and there were some parts that were heart raceing and another part were it was funny so all around i supper recommend to watch this movie it will have you in love it has alot of action
446,"May 16, 2020",8,"What I like: it's a good ending. It's connected with the previous plot. It's about the past and the future, reality and memory, emotion and choice. What I don't like: there are too many boring slogans; there is too much discord in the existence of the surprise captain, and there is no such shock in the trailer."
447,"Jul 23, 2019",10,Avengers Endgame is the best MCU movie ever. It truly justifies the end of Infinity Saga
448,"May 13, 2019",10,This film has brought a lot of attention to the marvel cinematic universe even for those who dont particularly watch marvel are going to the cinema to see this film. It amazes audiences with every minute of the film. This is not a film you wanna miss.
449,"May 5, 2019",10,I have never ever cried at a film....... until now. The most incredible and thrilling movie I have encountered. Marvel could not have made this film any better. They captured every moment perfectly. I really can not put into words just how fantastic this film is!
450,"Nov 2, 2019",8,"I can't believe it, why are people is giving this a 1/10 it's a Masterpiece and original people theses days just don't have good taste on movies they just go like other overrated movies the ending is so amazing"
451,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"I very much loved this movie, though the beginning act was very slow and drawn out making the film almost boring. The second and third act saved the movie as those were the best parts."
452,"Aug 2, 2019",3,"There's absolutely no pay off to be had plot wise here. Nothing to see here people. Fast forward through to the last hour and you're good. You will have missed nothing.This movie was either way too long or just nowhere near long enough. This was supposed to be a part II of conclusion that wraps up an entire universe of characters spanning 20 movies and they couldn't be arsed to give us a third act?Unfortunately, they titled the movie Avengers: Endgame, and making a sequel to that would be nearly as bad as having a movie titled Rambo: First Blood Part II. What would they have called a third movie? Avengers: The Really Real End Time, Place, Realm. (No, we honestly mean it this time.)Sadly, the first hour or so of the movie is Ant Man trying to save a tacked on, marketing driven first act that pays off in no way. Meanwhile, also tied to marketing, some major plot holes and omissions were completely egregious.A large portion of the principle photography for this movie was done alongside side Infinity Wars itself, which would've made sense if they'd had a coherent story line by then.Leave it to the screenwriters, they'll make something of it. Leave it to the editors, they'll fix it in post. Well, somebody forgot to fix it. And it wasn't me. Fortunately, marketing fixes everything.Let's face it, there are two kinds of people in this world: those who for a final movie who are just going to love it no matter what, those who view the movie with the same critical eye they would the others, and those who decide that there can only be two types of people.Why are there always two kinds of people? Look at Loki! Now that's an interesting character. He can be good; he can be bad. He's fiendish and lovable. He's a hero and a villain and an anti-hero and-still, somehow-human, god, and ice thing.Honestly, Infinity Wars couldn't have come at a worse time. It was originally a much larger unification of Marvel heroes and villains, and now that Disney owns all of the other Marvel Universe crap, that movie could've been the Infinity Wars, with a plot that started to wrap up before the last movie.Ah well, maybe in 20 years they'll redo the whole thing again with the X-Men and Silver Surfer in it (take or leave the Fan-4. This is super likely.I heard Spider Man: Far From Home was really really good, but I have no desire to see it. Why? Because it sounds to me like Spider Man visits France for Holiday and Meets some Good Guys and some Bad Guys and forces you to watch the credits so you can see 30 seconds that tease you into watching the next movie that's just going to do the same thing."
453,"May 5, 2019",10,"Best marvel film to come out to this date. It is extraordinary, mind boggling, you will definitely get lots of goosebumps. 10/10 for sure. The culmination of the last 11 years of Marvel movies has lead to this epic conclusion of the pinnacle of the infinity saga. The movie defied all odds and absolutely crushed it out of the park. Brimmed with emotions and swashbuckling fiesta. Avengers: Endgame delivers."
454,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"In life, I believe there is VERY LITTLE things that are either NEAR perfection or ARE perfection....Tonight, I witnessed perfection. Avengers: Endgame is simply so UNBELIEVABLE, AMAZING and down right PERFECT.If I could give a strong firm handshake to each individual who worked on that movie, I would.They did it. They have made something that is so PERFECT that I may start questioning my own reality on how something could be so good.Watch Endgame. You will experience MANY things throughout the movie....But....Regret will NOT be one of them...."
455,"May 5, 2019",10,When I saw Endgame and Carol came on screen with her new haircut the gay in me actually moaned in the theater so loud my mom sitting next to me had to tell me to call down
456,"May 5, 2019",10,Absolute greatness done by marvel Everything about it is amazing
457,"May 14, 2019",10,Hands off to the last of MCU movies. This whole storyline was a masterpiece. I am going to see these movies again and again and again I will never stop. Thank you Marvel
458,"Jul 5, 2019",7,"The first half of the movie is incredibly boring, second half is awesome. No emotional attachment to the final scene, it dragged on way too long.Infinity war was way better in my opinion, better balance between action and slow scenes."
459,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"This movie gonna lead you about a teamwork even you're not useful in team. With a jokes and laugh. While watch it maybe you guess the way of the stories but sorry, what's really happening are so different and unpredictable"
460,"Jul 13, 2019",10,"Endgame is an epic adventure , emotional roller-coaster with full of plot twists and conclusion to all that 11 years of storytelling. while watching #endgame I was laughing so loud, clapping so hard and got emotional in the end. What an experience! Sooo Goood."
461,"May 3, 2019",10,"First off, a great applause to the members (Director, Writers, Crews, Cast etc..) behind the extraordinary movie. Avengers Endgame is a terrific example of that epic intimacy that Marvel does so well - alternating between glorious action and subtle character moments. Watching it almost feels like taking a wistful walk down memory lane, flanked on either side by a Russo brothers, our hands held firmly in theirs. . It was a perfect ""ending"" of the 21 Movies.The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. They captured the emotion perfectly. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath.Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited.Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. Thank you stan lee for making the superheroes ...."
462,"Apr 30, 2019",7,"Good movie, but the previous one was better.It was enjoyable but not as exciting as the one before."
463,"May 27, 2019",10,"Reading through some of the low mark reviews from what one can only presume are DC fans I can assure the hand full of people whom are yet to see this movie that this is without any doubt a masterpiece in modern movie making. I've read comments on how the first third of the film is 'too slow' but this is totally necessary due the need to portray the weight of devastation caused by the snap from the end of the Infinity War instalment, as a stand alone movie it's quite the spectacle however to truly appreciate it I would recommend seeing all the previous MCU movies from the past 10 years chronological to truly benefit from all the call backs. Go see it, buy it, marvel at it and maybe DC can learn a thing or two from it."
464,"May 4, 2019",10,Fitting end to such a legendary saga. Dont see how this can ever be topped.
465,"Nov 20, 2021",10,"No words except claps, cheers and cries. This movie is the greatest movie of 2019. A truly satisfying conclusion to the MCU. The Russo brothers have proven once again how good of filmmakers they are."
466,"May 27, 2019",10,"I've seen this 3 times now, and it's such a gift. As a lifelong comic book and movie nerd, I couldn't have asked for much more. Epic. Touching. So exciting."
467,"May 4, 2019",10,No spoilers. BEST movie saga wrap-up of ALL TIME! I've never seen a movie that was too good to spoil. It's that good!
468,"May 20, 2019",1,"Did i watch the same movie as everyone else? why are so many people leaving such high ratings for this movie? i guess it being the end of it factors in, but it just wasn't a good film. some good parts, but they take up like 3% of the film."
469,"Nov 2, 2019",10,"What a movie. The way the Russo Brothers has brought in the emotions, as well as the action scenes. Brilliant Screenplay, what an acting by all the actors especially, Robert Downey Jr. 3 hrs just flew, I did not get bored in any part, an engaging movie. VFX was great, Marvel has not compromised with its VFX. The best Avengers movie when compared with the other three. A visual treat for all the Marvel fans. Loved it."
470,"May 5, 2019",10,"Every time I get drawn into a discussion on a comicbook adaptation I will invariably utter the phrase ""Well, in the books...""I'm an old fan of the genre, having read many of the books that are being adapted now as a child. I get very nit-picky when a film strays too far from its source material. The MCU broke me of that. Gradually over the years I accepted new ideas, if introduced in a good way. The details can be mailable, so long as a core theme is adhered to.I walked into Endgame today having no idea what could happen, and no preconceptions about what should happen. The previous 21 (wow) movies all took their source materials in different ways, for better or worse. In the end the source gets a nod, but the characters remain faithful, which was the case here.Nothing of the sequence of events could have been predicted by me, a man whose read the original Infinity Stones series, and that was for the best. If I knew what was going to happen, it wouldn't have made for an enjoyable experience.What I watched was a denouement of an impressive 11 year, 22 film series, the likes of which happening again are extremely remote. I was filled with so much emotion by the end, alternating from cheering to sniffling, I walked out knowing only that I'll be going to see it once more while it is in theater just so I can properly digest what I saw.If you are watching this movie never having seen the previous films (meaning you've been living under a rock for a decade) you won't understand a thing that happens. But as a closing to a series, you could not have expected a better experience.'Nuff said."
471,"May 2, 2019",10,"Imma be honest: I was afraid this movie would be boring, overly sentimental and poorly written, but luckily IT IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS!! They managed to fill the surprisingly long run-time without boring the audience, and the plot managed to round up the character's stories very well. I was happy when I left the theatre even though the movie obviously had some sad parts. Before seeing it, I was worried I had hyped myself too much and would be disappointed, but instead I am glad that it ended in such a perfect way. Anyone who claims otherwise should be burned alive."
472,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"A worthy ending of ten year film history that was made! A absolutely stunning, great, funny and emotional film."
473,"Apr 28, 2019",7,"When I walked out of the theatre I was really pleased with what I had seen( not a 10/10, but a good 9). But the more I thought about it the more weak points I could spot. There were some scenes that made me feel very angry, like all the stuff they have done to my favourite hero Thor. It was funny at first but later it just got on my nerves and made me (and all other fans of him) aggressive. There were also some scenes where the writers just found conclusion that were too easy compared to the problems that had been there. The movie also had some holes in its plot and things that just didn't seem very logic. But the start was great and all in all Marvel delivered very well. All in all it was a very good and enjoyable movie with some very emotional moments."
474,"Mar 1, 2020",6,"The Russo brothers manage to conclude this chapter of the MCU in a satisfying enough way by exploring the effects of a post snap world and allowing a sense of finality.The biggest thing against this movie is without a doubt its pacing. The first act overstays its welcome bogging down the beginning and leaving me feeling bored. The movie does however quicken up a bit which sadly gives way to minor story problems and a bit of an underwhelming conclusion.I also felt that some arcs and pay offs were not properly followed up on, leading to some grievances and frustrations in terms of characters and movie set ups, though it is understandable why they would sideline some of these characters.Endgame may not be infinity war in terms of quality but it achieves what it sets out to do albeit in some problematic aways."
475,"Jul 8, 2019",2,There's There will be blood and more recently Leave No Trace. And then there's this crap. Acting that makes my eyes hurt and a story so bad I just want to stop watching (which I did). It's movies like this that makes me lose faith in the art of film making. And the rating 8.7 just makes me wanna stop talking to people. What a waste of money...
476,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Absolutely FANTASTIC movie!! Very worthy end to a long cinematic history. Not often a movie gets this emotional, funny, exciting and heroic all rolled into one very refined roll. The Russo brothers have done it! Absolutely blown away! From being corny now and then to an emotional rollercoaster right after that. A masterpiece!"
477,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"An epic end to the this Infinity Saga..It couldn't have been any better..To all those fans around the globe who have been waiting for this moment. I have to say this is worth Ur wait, this is the moment, this is the Endgame"
478,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"What an end to an epic series. A roller coaster of action, humour and emotions."
479,"Apr 26, 2019",8,It was inevitable that Infinity War set up too big a plotline for it to not be somewhat disappointing in the conclusion. Very sentimental (too sentimental?). These will not be popular opinions. Oh well.
480,"May 2, 2019",7,"The movie is fun and entertaining overall. But it is supposed to tie up all the loose ends of the previous films of this franchise, which contradicts with a lot of plots of this particular film. Maybe we should just turn a blind eye and give it a pass because this ending can't be more epic or whatever, but this is the one movie we've waited for so long for me to say like, that's such a great way to tie it up and all. Because it's not. There are so many inconsistencies and cringy moments in this movie. And it doesn't give me the feeling of Infinity War or Cival War. The level of conflict is just not there. So to sum it up, it is kinda enjoyable as a comedy, but I'm personally not satisfied in a whole bunch of ways."
481,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Yeah it's even much better than all Marvel and dc movies and much better than Dark knight. Finally Marvel did it👌 More than a Movie
482,"Sep 15, 2019",7,Avengers endgame one of the most anticipated movies of 2019 was watchable. The story was way too predictable except the ending. Movie contains some of the best VFX graphics well it's Marvel. The performances of the actors is also very brilliant. MCU fans won't want to miss it.
483,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Everything that's happened over the past 11 years has been leading to this, and it's all put together beautifully. In my opinion, there are 3 movies to rewatch before watching Endgame: Iron Man 1, Winter Soldier, and Infinity War."
484,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Had some really good twists, overall awesome 3 hours!"
485,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Fruitful movie with lots of surprises. I believe i didn't witness a better movie than this.
486,"Apr 26, 2019",10,This movie was an excellent film that fulfills expectations and maintains a serious tone but doesn't fail to make you laugh. In the audience there are audible cheers as each character is revealed and tears among all audience members as the sad inevitably happens. The bad reviews often overlook the culture and environment this film gives easy 20/10
487,"May 12, 2019",6,"Don't know what all the hype was about! The film is one hour too long because there just wasn't enough action. The Hulk was not so ""Incredible"" & Thor was not much of a ""God"" I was rather perplexed by how underutilised some of the characters were given the powers they have. The ending had potential, but unfortunately it failed to deliver. It's good but not great."
488,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Greatest movie ever. Hats off to the creators and the cast. Would recommend everyone one out there to watch it. Has everything nostalgic to sentimental vibes a perfect example of what a new era movie should be. I bet even the toughest men alive will cry watching it. Respect to those who sacrificed themselves in the making of a great legacy.
489,"May 4, 2019",7,"Come on people. Why is every Marvel movie so overrated? I rate them as what they deserve. Infinity War was pretty much the only outstanding movie in the franchise. They did something what noone dared before. That was a very good movie.This one? 7 at best. How on Earth can anyone just a little bit of brain rate this higher over movies Inception, Matrix, Goodfellas, etc almost the whole top250 movies. Are you mad? For real..This one was full of nonsense. They basicly setup something that shows and tells you who's how strong. When they show in the end of Infinity War that Thor now can beat Thanos easily, then how comes that he still has all the power but Thanos now can rip him apart without a single stone.Glad it is finally ended. Sick of seeing every trash being in the top250 because of little fan boys that haven't even seen sh**."
490,"May 28, 2019",1,"It was ok, not great just ok. I like infinity war more."
491,"Sep 16, 2021",10,Because dc fans are jealous and taking s.h.i.t without even watching it.
492,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"The best end for marvel studio movies, and best story and drama"
493,"Apr 30, 2019",8,"After seeing ENDGAME for the second time, I'm ready to write my review, which will be difficult to do without spoilers. I find it interesting that those who gave INFINITY WAR a 10 were disappointed in this movie and I think I know why (for I am one of them) - INFINITY WAR took so many characters, such different tones in the worlds of the different heroes, with such a big story arc, yet managed to tell real stories interweaving the larger story, not just 3 minute cameos. ENDGAME, although having real moments of pathos, missed that balance. Despite moments of humour (many at cost of Thor's character, which I didn't appreciate), this movie basically had one tone and I was disappointed how some of our heroes were marginalized (and given bad haircuts). I know it was the end of an era, a passing of the torch. As a friend put it, ""Character development was never the focus of this movie, that was what all the previous movies were for...it was a perfect wrap up and set up for the next arc."" I agree this was all about the ensemble but there were edits (or complete changes) to our heroes' journeys for which I didn't care (too many stories were left off screen) with one exception (Nebula has a character arc). So, that's why I didn't enjoy this as much as INFINITY WAR yet it was still a great movie with great performances by all the cast, poignant moments of loss, great montages in the battle scenes and a real challenge demanding great cost. Kudos to the Russos and Kevin Feige for their hands at the tiller for this era. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Adventure}"
494,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"What a masterpiece. I'm still in tears, even after 7 hours.. It was better than anything I've imagined."
495,"Apr 29, 2019",6,"I will not tell you anything about the plot, simply because almost everything in it can be considered as a spoiler, but I can convey my attitude. It was neither good nor bad.The plot is linear, simple and predictable. Classic Marvel.There was a lot of humor in the movie. Too much, especially considering the atmosphere of loss and hopelessness, which was at the end of the ""Infinity War"" and which one is trying to get to believe here.And I liked the final action scene.So in fact, I have nothing more to say about this movie. An entire era has passed. This is just the end.This is endgame."
496,"Aug 1, 2019",10,"It perfectly concluded the movies I have been watching from the beginning. Acting was amazing, story was spectacular, and even though it was darker than most marvel movies, they still incorporated light-hearted comedy."
497,"Apr 27, 2019",8,"This movie was a great conclusion to the last 11 years of the MCU. You will laugh, you will cheer and you will even cry. This movie takes multiple unexpected turns. When this movie unfolds you surprisingly get to learn more about the characters that survived the Snap. MCU took a different style of storytelling which was very risky for a marvel movie, but they pulled it off. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I strongly recommend that you stay away from as many spoilers as possible. Trust me, the less you know about the movie the more you will love it. Go see it ASAP. I love it 3000."
498,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"I'm not being biased as a hard core Marvel fan this movie concluded my childhood and teenage years and that's it , it's an emotional tear jearker . Don't expect it to be as action packed as Infinity War - for me the best super hero movie ever - and to make such sense as Infinity War"
499,"May 30, 2019",9,"Positives: Directing, script and cinematographyMain castAction scenesMost of the humorScopeIt was a perfect conclusion for 22 movies in 11 yearsNegatives: Not much"
500,"Sep 16, 2019",10,Among few best you get to watch in a years .Avengers endgame is one of them.
501,"Apr 24, 2019",6,"It takes some time to get going. Then there is this obsession to try to be funny, that is sometimes a bit annoying. The Final Battle is way to overloaded and that not very subtile feministic scene at the end of the battle is kind of pathetic (you will get what I mean, when you see it). I love female superheros, but that particular scene doesn't make sense at all. Please stop ruining good movies, with political statements. It's worth a watch, no doubt, but I was kind of disappointed. Its way to melodramatic for a freaking superheromovie."
502,"Apr 25, 2019",8,Infinity War was better. I expected from Endgame less humor and more thrilling scenes but that's ok.
503,"Apr 25, 2019",10,This truly was worth every second of wait. I first seen it on the midnight screening. I must have watched it 5 times since and I cry every single time lol. Cracking end to a fab set of movies.
504,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"I'm not going to spoil anything. All I have of say is I laughed, I cried, and I got chills down my spine throughout the whole movie. The theater was packed to the rim, and everyone in my row got up in tears. This movie might have been the best I have ever seen, and I will definitely watch it again and again once it come out on the tv. Definitely as good as infinity war, and in my opinion better. If you love the avengers, you will love this movie."
505,"May 4, 2019",8,"After Infinity War I was waiting for marvelous final in End Game, but Marvel surprised me in negative way. They finished one the greatest franchise ever as drama and tragedy. They added so many dialogues that some people has been falling asleep. After dynamical Infinity War they gave us a so slow motion film. And finally, that what they did with Captain America it's a disaster for time theory!"
506,"Apr 24, 2019",6,"The movie is entertaining and time will fly faster than expected as you're in it. On any standard I do recommend the movie if not for anything else, but for it's entertainment value. I do believe the hype that is going on around the movie will be letting some people down.I'm in between giving it a 6 or 7 because of the well executed entertainment value it provides. I will have to round it down to 6 because of the amount of 10's this movie is getting at the moment. The movie neither blows your brains with plot twists or anything like that.Comparing this purely to other superhero movies I'd give this one a 9-. I think Infinity Wars was better, but this concludes the Avenger series perfectly."
507,"Aug 7, 2019",1,It lacked many of the major events that we were wanting for
508,"Dec 20, 2021",8,"Avengers: Endgame is a depressing and emotional conclusion of the long awaiting Infinity Saga. The final product is not what I had hoped for, but the Russo Brothers created something special that reflex the wholesome of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This film marks the end of an era for some of our beloved characters that we cherished and loved. Going down memory lane is not an easy task, but we sit through 181 minutes to say goodbye to our favorite Avenger. A proper farewell is necessary for Tony Stark and Robert Downey Jr. Because he helped to build this franchise juggernaut that reaping billions at the box office.As the first Avenger and leader of the world's mightiest heroes, Steve Rogers will always be the patron saint of the MCU. Chris Evans helped to shape Captain America as the poster boy for American patriotism and his departure will leave a huge gap and we can hope that his new successor will continue his path of righteousness and compassion.Avengers: Endgame failed Black Widow and she deserves better."
509,"Sep 5, 2019",10,"One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. The plots really stunned me. It's a filled with everything that a movie should have. Great respect to Joe and Anthony and the full credit goes to the father of MCU, Stan Lee 😍😍😍"
510,"May 17, 2021",10,Super timeline and super plot. I can watch it 100 times. Just ending is too sad.
511,"Oct 29, 2019",10,This movie was a perfect sendoff. I can't even describe what I liked since I would be here all day. I was crying of joy and sadness the entire last hour. Was definetely worth the extra price for IMAX.
512,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"""This is going to work, Steve.""""I know it will. Because I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.""So spoke Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to Captain America (Chris Evans) in the opening act of Avengers: Endgame. Quite poetically, leading into this crossover event, the above interaction no doubt reflects the minds of all Marvel fans flooding to see Endgame in the coming weeks. Naturally, fans are longing to watch their favourite characters together on screen for one last blast, but also desperate that the conclusion to this incredible 11-year journey lives up to expectations.Endgame's prologue sees our heroes defeated; Thanos' (Josh Brolin) infamous finger-snap at the end of Avengers: Infinity War - coined officially as 'The Decimation' - has wiped out half of all living creatures in the universe. Now, the Avengers must unite one more time to reverse this grave catastrophe, ""whatever it takes.""So, has Marvel managed to make this overwhelmingly ambitious project ""work""? The short answer: yes. Infinite times over, yes. Avengers: Endgame is not only a truly engrossing culmination to the 'Infinity Saga', it is also nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece.The journey that began with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in Iron Man back in 2008 is very intelligently tied up in Endgame. As the film unfolds, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's meticulous story planning becomes evident and gradually proves to be the most satisfying payoff any Marvel fan could have hoped for. Marvel President Kevin Feige alongside directors Anthony and Joe Russo have completed an impossible feat; Endgame is humorous, heart-breaking and perpetually captivating. It more than exceeds any presupposition laid before it with a swagger more equanimous than Stark's ego, whilst also moulding an open route forward for the inevitable continuation of this formidable franchise. It's one-of-a-kind experience; the perfect milestone to end this gigantic adventure, yet a glorious beginning for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Endgame's greatest filmic achievement though, lies in its steady pace and indulgent narrative; taking things slow but never wasting time, yet speeding along whilst never rushing, everything fits perfectly into place in this 3-hour work of genius with a sophistication indicative of a Francis Ford Coppola paragon. Sure, it's a high-budget superhero blockbuster featuring spectacular special effects, but as Marvel has proven before, that doesn't mean a superhero film cannot tackle tones and styles not necessarily affiliated with the genre. In the realisation of its ambition, Endgame catapults the superhero genre to an unprecedented spectrum of film accomplishment; it is quite frankly a piece of cinematic art, encapsulating yet conquering all that has come before it with majesty and self-assuredness.But as noted by Stark, ""part of the journey is the end"", and now the curtain draws on this dazzling superhero adventure. Though the encore of 'Phase Three' is yet to be seen in Spider-Man: Far From Home (releasing this July), Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent finale which allows The Avengers we so know and love the opportunity to sign off in remarkable fashion, leaving behind a Hulk-sized stamp on Hollywood history which will remain for 'infinity'.Avengers... Assemble. And take a bow."
513,"Sep 15, 2019",10,Never thought that a superhero movie could make me as emotional as this one did. RDJ's turn as IronMan was brilliant. To see the character develop from the first IronMan movie to this iteration was a journey well worth taking. And to have the story wrap up with all the characters and plot lines coming together was mind-blowing. A modern classic that sucks you in from the word go.
514,"Mar 22, 2021",1,Spectacle and nothing else as fans said here its meant to be for them but even they dont like it totally undermines the excellent previous movies for too much fanservice and useless plot threads that go nowhere sadly ive seen this movie twice and regretted it both times such a slack way to wrap up what was mostly a good-excellent run of movies
515,"Oct 22, 2021",9,"Maybe not the best mcu movie, but the one I find the most satisfying. Watching this in theaters for the first time was truly an experience. This is essentially 3 separate movies- a post apocalyptic drama (act 1), a time heist (act 2), and an epic (act 3). It may not hold up as well on rewatch, but there is nothing like watching this movie for the first time."
516,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"To say this movie was awesome is an understatement. I'm still processing everything but OMG was it truly a masterpiece. I'm struggling to think if I've ever given a 10 before, but if I have it's only ever been one or two in my life. This certainly was a 10... However you definitely need to see ALL the movies from 2008's Iron Man through Infinity war. And I do mean ALL of them for this movie to truly shine or even to make sense. Even given the 3 hour running time this movie makes no attempts to fill you in, and nor should it. You need to be well prepared going into thisThat said I saw the opening night fan event showing, and got a commemorative coin that is actually metal, heavy, and super cool! But it was shown in a regular theater with mediocre sound, so I also have tickets for a showing on Friday as well in a Dolby theater room, which I can't wait to see. Now I loved Avengers Infinity War, but I laughed, cheered and got way more emotional in this movie than that one. I've been in theaters where the crowd cheered or laughed before, but I don't think I've ever seen it let alone experienced it to this degree. The emotions were just flowing to say the least.I really liked how the first act brought you into the aftermath of this post-snap world, and really focused on the hardship of what things would have been like after such an event. And while this was all very sad the one thing I was shocked about was that they successfully pulled off so much humor. Humor in a marvel movie is no surprise, but given how Infinity War ended I really thought this was going to be a dark and dreary movie, and yet it gave me some of the best laughs while still taking itself serious. It's quite a magic act to pull offThe second act really sets the game plan in motion for how they plan to ""fix"" things and while suspenseful and intriguing it still kept up great and appropriate humor. Obviously humor is a subjective thing and some might bash it. I tend not to like potty humor style but more organic or situational humor, which I thought they just nailed. But at the same time there were some heartache moments that just brought you on the edge of your seat, or made you wipe your eyes. Towards the middle of the movie I was just glued to my seatAnd then there's the third act. OMG... As you would expect it sets up a mega finish as they really are wrapping up the culmination of 11 years and 20+ films worth of story lines and this is what it's all about. The action was great, effects second to none, a bit chaotic at times but that just adds to the intensity. There were moments I just yelled and cheered like I never have at a movie before. I watched it with my daughter who I've taken to or seen every one of the marvel movies with and we were clenching each other through the last 15-20 minutes as it was just so intense, amazing and emotional.Coming out of the movie we were both just stunned and in awe, just trying to process the emotions of what we just saw. To bring out so much emotion in us, and from what we saw so many others is just unbelievable. That in itself just tells you how extraordinary this movie was and is a true credit to everyone involved in making this film. All I can say is don't read any spoilers as there are sure to be some now that it's out. Get some tickets, go and see it for yourself, you will not regret it, but again if you've missed any of the movies in between Iron Man and Infinity war, get caught up first."
517,"May 28, 2019",10,"This movie was meant to be watched in an IMAX theater, especially because the sound makes up a very important part of the movie. To be honest, there were times when I felt that this movie is definitely 3 hours, but I can see why it was so necessary. This movie truly delivers what it promises it would! This movie really marks an important era in cinema."
518,"Jun 22, 2019",10,"Once you start watching this movie you do not want to stop. This is just not a movie it is much more than that. One picture says more than 1000 words , so go and see this amazing movie!"

521,"Apr 28, 2019",6,In my opinion this was a huge dissappointment for me. The movie lacks of action and full of irrational content. Its very slow and boring. First half was unnecessary and second half is below par. Im so sad that nearly nothing significant happened in whole 180 minutes. I was expecting the same vibe as infinity war or dark knight but this was more like age of ultron.
522,"May 3, 2019",8,I don't wanna spoil. honestly don't get over hyped. its not 10 star or 9. it deserves 8 Made for Marvel fans Not good as Infinity war but not bad for 3 hours Hilarious Thor! :D
523,"Mar 7, 2021",2,"I don't know how the movie get 8.4....i was getting crazy couldn't wait till the movie is over, that much it's was boring and I didn't understand at all 3 hour what is it all about, from first til lthe end."
524,"Oct 19, 2019",10,"That was the best movie Marvel i ever seen, everything are brilliant the all actors unbelievable for acting that movie, it deserves any trophy in these years."
525,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"If you are a marvel fan: you will watch it anyway, STOP LOOKING FOR SPOILERS And if you aren't a marvel fan: go watch every marvel movie ever right now. Stop reading. GO!!!"
526,"May 7, 2019",10,"I love superhero movies. So consider this a genre I truly enjoy and I review this title considering it's not art; it's entertainment. And in that sense, it's emotional, exciting, dramatic, action packed with the perfect amount of humor. It's no wonder it's the most anticipated superhero movie of all times, and no wonder why it has grossed so much. The movie promised to be awesome and was an understatement. If you like superheroes like me, you're gonna love it. Never before had so many heroes appeared together and, finally, working as a team. Now; to all of the people who expected an art movie, of course you didn't like it. It's an action film with amazing special effects and awesome action scenes and fabulous characters."
527,"Sep 15, 2019",10,"I am totally blown away! The whole summer I sat and watched through the whole MCU and was so hyped for Endgame. It didn't disappoint. I love how great the balance between action and emotional character scenes was. And the character development! I don't understand why everyone criticize Hawkeyes development, cuz it was great. I love how he has gone from a totally boring action character in avengers 1 to a character you cared about. He made me cry so many times. That's a point too. I cried so much, and I have a hard time crying when I watch movies. And the time travel aspect that got so much critic. I love how they actually made a great thing about the quantum realm. When I watched Ant-man I thought about this, and finally! And the ending of Captain America... I have literally not cried so much in my whole life. What a great ending to one of the greatest humans of history! It's just one thing though, you have to be a marvel and watch the whole mcu before to understand. But I'm a marvel nerd, so I'm pleased! Go watch it right now, and prepare to become emotional and lose your whole supply off tears!"
528,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Believe me, in 3 hours I didn't blink my eye. There are few visual glitches despite story telling, direction and everything that give you full 3000 times satisfaction."
529,"May 4, 2019",6,This is an average one time watch.Not at all matching the hype caused due to tremendous success of it's predecessor movies.Average script and below par action sequences.You are better off rewatching GOT.A lot left to be desired out of this.
530,"Feb 5, 2021",2,Too long for bad plot. The movie is 3 t 1 min use your time better!
531,"Aug 25, 2019",10,"Exciting, fun, solid and beautiful, worthy of Oscar"
532,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"As all of you have been, I've been waiting for this movie for a long long time. We've all had our expectations set high, and let me just say you could not see anything coming your way. Avengers Endgame is the perfect culmination of the eleven years of movies Marvel has given us, perfectly balanced, as all things should be. You're gonna cry, you're gonna laugh, you're gonna be surprised. Solid 10/10."
533,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Once is not enough to watch this movie. It blew me away.
534,"May 1, 2019",6,"Endgame is a fun movie to go see, it has its problems but is a fun movie. These reviews on here giving it 10 out of 10 and saying that is the first perfect movie are 100% wrong. Dont go in expecting this movie to be better than godfather or citizen kane as these reviews describe. It's a fun movie with fun action, no it's not an oscar contender, no it's not a ground breaking never before been done movie, and no it is not a 10 out of 10 perfect movie. Go in expecting a fun watch with some cringy comedy and you will enjoy the experience. But dont listen to the people saying that this is a perfect movie, or the best ever made."
535,"Apr 26, 2019",2,I was bored throughout this movie. 1. Nothing really happens for most of the movie and there are so many unnecessary long scenes. 2.There is one really good fight/ action sequence. 3. THEY DID THOR SO WRONG. I watched Infinity war the night before and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. With endgame I was looking at my phone the whole time hoping something would happen.
536,"Aug 24, 2019",9,"I was a little late watching this one and had heard a lot of mixed reviews leading up to doing so; however, I personally thought this was the best possible conclusion to the current Avengers storyline. Or... the conclusion for now at least.First of all, I really enjoyed getting to see a more human side of all the Avengers in this one. I thought the film makers did an amazing job at really giving us the time to connect with each and every super hero in this franchise if we hadn't thus far. Doing so really helped set the stage for the ""Endgame"", if you will. I really enjoyed the main characters throughout this film as well. I thought Thanos had wiped out the majority of my favorites with his infinity stone snap, but I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed the remaining characters and how well they worked together throughout the film.Also, I just can't say enough about how beautiful the Marvel films are and how well the CGI, costumes, and FX are done. For a film series that relies so heavily on FX and CGI, they manage to pull it off so smoothly and seamlessly.It's hard to go too far with a review without giving away any of the storyline; however, I feel that any true fan has already seen the film at this point. For those who haven't I can only say to come out from under the rock you're living under and check out this amazing piece of cinema history.I give Avengers: Endgame a 9 out of 10!!!PS - Captain Marvel is soooooo badass!!!!"
537,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Well, the magnificent saga ends with a such great and satisfying conclusion which gives you the best cinematic experience of your life. Unexpected, brilliant and an all together masterpiece."
538,"Jun 20, 2021",10,"What a cinema experience. Saw this opening night and the cheering that erupted at certain points gave instant goosebumps. A couple of legendary moments in the movie that I will never forget. Nothing has come close and I feel like nothing else ever will. Over 20 movies have led to this, and Endgame delivered big time.There really isn't much else to say. The movie is packed full of every emotion. One simply has to have made the great journey to appreciate this masterpiece. This is the peak of the MCU and I fear it will only decline, but time will tell."
539,"Apr 25, 2019",9,"It was always going to be a challenge to create a movie that neatly ties up a decade of continuity and juggles a cast of characters built up over 22 films and the fear was that End Game was going to be anticlimactic. Fans do not fear, the Russo's have crafted a near perfect film from its heart wrenching opening to its close. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll weep and you'll leave the cinema pretty happy with the experience. If you are new to the Marvel Universe then this is not for you and will appear to be a jumbled mess of a film but for anyone who has been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Iron Man back in 2008 this is everything you wanted to see."
540,"Apr 29, 2019",3,Standard story with happy end with a lot of tearful and stupid dialogs. A battle till about 10-15 mins from 3 hours.
541,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This was absolutely the best possible way the universe could of ended. Acting was amazing, directing flawless. 10/10"
542,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"I am waiting for this movie from the day I watched Avengers Assemble movie in 2012... Perfect Ending.There is no movie such grand in past or in recent times, not even star wars( sorry fans but its the fact). Marvel put every trick possible in this movie. I laughed, I got Thrilled and got Excited. Cried in the end and am happy while coming out of the cinema.The makers tried their level best to portray such big story in 3hr time.... Even 3hrs are not enough to cover every detail, hence little flaws."
543,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I felt like my 10 year relationship had just ended.... but it was good, really good!"
544,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"If you're reading this, go watch the movie (again)."
545,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Without doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. I was completely gripped from the beginning. Fantastic performances by all of the cast (not that we'd expect any less), I find it hard to pick a favourite character because they're all so awesome, in this film more so than ever. I was on the edge of my seat throughout all of the action sequences, and have known few films to evoke such intense feelings of hope, and also great sadness/ loss. The humour throughout the film is spot on, and in one of the most important final scenes you could have heard a pin drop in the cinema, it was like everybody was holding their breath - staring at the screen in complete disbelief. As far as I can tell, no one saw that coming which is a credit to the writers and directors who were able to piece everything together so cleverly. It's an absolute masterpiece. Just one warning, though - if you're anything like me you'll need to go armed with tissues."
546,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I've just returned from watching Avengers: Endgame on opening night. As a fan of Marvel for over three decades I had many expectations and thoughts about what this movie might bring, and this movie was nothing that I expected. It brought us both the best (and worst in my opinion) versions of Earth's mightiest heroes. And I'm sure that many out there will disagree with me on which is which. What is undeniable is that the Russo's have managed to achieve what many (including myself) thought impossible, to deliver a film which pays tribute to the past decade's 21 (not including Endgame itself) Marvel Cinematic Universe offerings, whilst simultaneously closing out the story lines and creating an epic masterpiece in itself. It has humour (some of good), action, emotion and genuinely something for everyone all rolled up into an epic three hours of entertainment, which goes by in a flash. Well done, fantastic work.Thanos, it's Hammertime!"
547,"Apr 28, 2019",6,Thor is spoiled in this movie.captain America is playing with Thor's hammer is likely very funny. Thanos performance is very powerful.storyline is also average.....when you going to theatre not excepted very much.
548,"Aug 8, 2019",10,"It's just a masterpiece, everything is looking pretty good!"
549,"Jul 25, 2021",5,What a let down. They ruined Thor & Hulk. Could have been amazing.
550,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Best avengers series am gonna miss them everyone should watch this
551,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"THE LOW-DOWN: Statistically, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has achieved a great deal: over 11 years and 21 films, it has introduced dozens of relatively obscure characters into mainstream pop culture. More importantly, however, the franchise has proven that long-form storytelling can work in a cinematic context - as long as you balance plot with heart and humour, prizing character development over spectacle. That's no small feat, and it's even more remarkable that a movie with the gargantuan scale and ambition of Avengers: Endgame doesn't fall apart beneath the weight of an unwieldy script or great expectations. In fact, this is the MCU's crowning achievement: a heartfelt love letter to the Avengers, their stories, the actors who play them, and to the fans.THE STORY: That damn Snap, eh? At the end of Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos wiped out half of the galaxy's population with a snap of his Infinity-Stone-enhanced fingers. After bearing witness to teammates and loved ones vanishing in swirls of dust and ash, the remaining Avengers struggle to live with the crippling grief and guilt of surviving the Snap... and of failing to prevent it. Some characters spiral into darkness; others are frozen in place - a few even manage to move on. But hope is rekindled when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) returns from the mysterious Quantum Realm, where the usual laws of physics, space and time do not apply...THE GREAT: Endgame is a storytelling triumph - not only does it bring together and pay off plots and ideas that were seeded over a decade ago, it builds solid, powerful, heartrendingly emotional narrative arcs for almost all of the original Avengers. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) must grapple with their pasts to figure out their futures, while Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) find themselves literally fighting to save their families. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) might provide much of the film's comic relief, but both characters are also gifted with grace notes, growth and moments of true peace.THE SUPER-GREAT: The ability to juggle and create space for multiple perspectives and storylines in one film has been honed to a fine art by directors Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. But their narrative strategy feels virtuosic in Endgame, paired as it is with an ingenious plot device that allows the film to truly acknowledge the staggering depth and breadth of its own history. Suddenly, the emotional and narrative stakes are raised, as beloved characters are forced to re-examine their lives, stories and priorities. You might find yourself in tears and in stitches, frequently in the same scene, and this happens throughout the film - a testament to the Russo Brothers' genius and their skills at anchoring even the most outlandish of storylines in humour and humanity.THE NOT-SO-GREAT: This is emphatically not a film for casual viewers - there is no entry point, no easing in, no exposition, to help you understand what the heck is going on if you haven't watched most of the preceding films in the MCU. There are also a few logical fallacies and plotholes scattered throughout Endgame that will puzzle you the more you think about them - from the wobbly rules governing time travel to the fractured way in which the too-conveniently hyper-powered Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) pops in and out of the story.STAN SERVICE: This film, above all others in the MCU, feels like a heartfelt tribute to the very concept of Marvel itself, finding numerous ways to reward and delight true-blue fans. Naturally, it includes Stan Lee's final appearance in the MCU, while folding in a host of other cameos and callbacks that reinforce the interconnectedness of the entire franchise - of all the stories that have been told before, especially the movie that started it all (Iron Man in 2008). There are even a couple of brilliant nods to comics lore, largely centred around the character of Captain America, that feel like the Russo Brothers are deliberately righting a few wrongs where some of Marvel Comics' more controversial plot twists are concerned. (See: Nick Spencer's run on Captain America: Steve Rogers.)CAST-IRON MVP: Casting outside of the box has always been one of the MCU's core strengths, with Oscar winners/nominees and character actors regularly popping up to play heroes and villains alike. That canny casting strategy pays off in spades in Endgame - especially when certain characters have relatively limited screen time but manage to make it count anyway. The undisputed stars of the movie, however, are the Avengers who started it all. Hemsworth continues to brilliantly dance along the knife-edge between comedy and pathos, while Ruffalo radiates charm and intelligence through ever-improving CGI as Banner and his not-so-mean, green alter ego: The Hulk. Johansson and Renner are given more to do in this film than ever before, and their combined efforts will shred your soul to pieces. Evans brings great warmth and strength to his stoic role, making it perfectly legitimate for you to weep and whoop for a man who's - somewhat ridiculously - wrapped in an American flag. Above all, this double-whammy of Avengers films belongs, most fittingly, to Downey Jr. He still effortlessly injects Tony with snark and swagger, but also beautifully conveys every shade and layer of his character's hard-won growth and maturity - giving us all the proof that we have never needed that Tony Stark has a heart.RECOMMENDED? In every imaginable way. Endgame sets the bar as high as it can possibly go for superhero epics that balance enormous scale and jaw-dropping ambition with actual substance and genuine emotion. It's the blockbuster movie event of our lifetimes, for very good reason - and it's worth every minute you've invested in the MCU since 2008."
552,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"People laughed, clapped their hands, some of them cried (including me). And what a satisfying ending, honestly this is best one yet."
553,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"Walking in, given Marvel's latest publicity, I was expecting, well, I was expecting an absolute cringe fest, and thankfully I didn't get it. In fact, there were only a couple of absolute cringe moments and each dealt with Brie Larson, particularly her appearance in the final fight.Thankfully though, Marvel showed a lot of restraint with that and as a result the movie really belonged to the characters that we all have invested over a decade of love and loyalty in....and honestly that was a relief. There were times where the film looked like it wanted to go the other way, and put the OG Avengers in the backseat. So, credit for not doing that.It feels a lot more like Kill Bill 2 in atmosphere than a real Super-Hero movie, all the really fun big fights were reserved for the first film and what's left is a long closing act that is more concerned with tying up loose ends than delivering on over-the-top action. And it works for a send off film after a decade of investment.So what you have feels very much like an intimate and sentimental film made by old friends at send off...or a funeral...but in either case it is absolutely appropriate.Unfortunately, you have the enormously epic CGI battle at the end and I, for one, am kind of done with that trope. It's starting to bore me now, and, honestly, I would prefer something a little more authentic. But, that being said, the film at least called for it.We've seen battles like that before, Black Panther, Aquaman, Infinity War, Lord of the Rings, and, honestly those CGI armies lack any real intimacy. So the end is kind of a bore compared to the rest of the film.The highlight in the film would be Thor with Hulk coming in as a close second. They steal the show from the moment they are introduced and the trademark MCU humor that Black Panther and Captain Marvel utterly lacked. And the humor was a source of comfort after two films that made vague threats of taking themselves far too seriously for a superhero flick.The wrap-up was more than satisfying if not heart-wrenching at moments making it a great send off for a decade of time and money invested in the characters, however the legacy that the MCU is passing on seems in trouble nonetheless and we can only hope that it doesn't go the route that the MCU has been teasing and toying with and continues to deliver fun superhero movies and not the heavy-handed or deadly serious films they have threatened the audience with."
554,"Apr 8, 2024",8,"Its good. But I liked the way Infinity Wars ended better. Time travel stories are hard to like because anything can happen by just messing with it. And that's what they did. They used time to fix a problem. Now I get it, Time is a thing. Its worth telling stories about. Its just so hard to do well.Besides that, the story is OK. Classic superhero stuff. Its still a good movie. Certainly for what its worth, its a good finally to everything leading up to this movie. Its nice to see the paths of all the superheros coming together to fight the ultimate evil. Or so we think.Thanatos is powerful. But hes not Loki powerful..."
555,"Nov 25, 2019",10,"This movie was epic! I felt soooo many emotions and was so sad it ended. If they do other movies, idk how I will feel about someone else playing these characters."
556,"Apr 19, 2020",8,"I was born in the 1990s, and I used to envy the ""previous generation "": audiences 40 years ago, whose theaters had the closing scenes of the original Star Wars trilogy; Audiences 20 years ago could see the final chapter of the Lord of the rings in the cinema. Fans have had their ups and downs, but now we have a common memory: the marvel cinematic universe. Thank you, the avengers."
557,"May 4, 2019",6,"This could've been sooo much better, some great scenes and then the horrific route taken with the characters of Thor and Hulk! Some nice touches and fight scenes but left disappointed. Totally agree with so many others that infinity war was the better movie."
558,"Aug 7, 2019",3,"...and if I lasted more than an hour, I'd probably come up with more adjectivesthis is THE worst superhero movie in a line of really bad films. all the 'old' cast (who reeeaally got older throughout the marvel cineverse) looks like they've just came to get their final paycheck. it just feels forced, like a bad commercial, or like a prog rock song that should've ended few minutes ago. none of what we see makes any sense, there's no sensible plot , even ""fun stuff"" comes off as rather sad. and that's the word that describes the final (?) avengers movie the best way - sad..."
559,"Apr 26, 2019",10,This movie has done anything better like What Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 did. A perfect movie that has a perfect ending.
560,"Nov 30, 2019",10,"This movie is great, emotional, epic with lots of great moments and the ending of the movie is the best and when the movie ends, there is going to be a smile on your face with lots of tears on your eyes. The only people who say this movie is bad are only toxic dc fans and the ones who don't know what is cinema. Endgame absolutely is the best marvel and the best comic book movie have ever made."
561,"May 6, 2019",10,If you invested in all of the films that came before it then you will probably be very happy. Are there plot holes? Sure. Is anything in the movie probable at all in the real world? No. It's a movie. Go into it with an open mind and enjoy the ride. Nice job Russo's.
562,"May 26, 2019",10,"The start of Avengers Endgame leaves every single spectator cold and sympathized locating them in a world after-the-snap where the emptiness that left those who have left and the pain of those who are still, have been present during five long years. Then, The Avengers discover a very risky posibility for bringing everybody back, but our heroes will try it ""Whatever it takes"". Followed by this discovery, Marvel transports us towards a ride through several of the events that ocurred in its cinematographic universe to gather again the infinity gems paying tribute to more than 10 years of films. After this trip that brings with it a very hight cost, we find ourselves with a spectacular and emotive third act full of an overwhelming fan-service that will never be forgotten by its fans, closing masterfully and uniquely the Infinity Saga. The movie came with very high expectations and managed not only to accomplish all of them, but to avercome more than enough them, and Marvel gives fans everything they have dreamed about. The only thing against this film is that it can never be equealed or overcome, locating it on the cusp of Marvel's cinematographic world and leaving too many hight expectations for later films that, even though, we know we'll love them as they always make us do."
563,"Apr 25, 2019",6,"What a waste of a film. The first hour was totallly wasted. Yes there were good bits in it, but a stupid story with a boring script couldn't save this."
564,"Mar 23, 2020",8,"Part four of this gigantic Avengers saga cannot really be evaluated alone. It is directly related to part three. You can put them together like two pieces of a puzzle. In my opinion, both together are much better than parts 1 and 2.I'm excited. From the end of Part 3 at the latest, I was completely in the Avengers Universe. The action, the drama. Everything at a very high level, despite the many characters and superheroes. But the special thing about the Avengers is that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are not afraid to break taboos. In part four it is tough and it rarely gets cheesy or boring. Despite the very long three-hour runtime. In addition to all the superhero films, some of which dissolve into insignificance, Avengers looks like a little masterpiece."
565,"May 3, 2019",9,"Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team."
566,"Apr 28, 2019",10,What a spectacular end of Avengers series by Marvel.. Perfect ending..Better than expected..Feeling sad because its a end of era.. Marvel U entertained us from past 11 year and now no more avengers .. Just feel the movie 😊😊
567,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Everything Marvel has to offer is brought on the table by this film
568,"Apr 27, 2019",6,Predicted end ! Weak drama ! Graphics was not that high !Infinity war was way better than this !
569,"Mar 29, 2020",9,"Finally, the long-awaited conclusion of a saga that was weaved ingeniously and meticulously for a decade by the House of Ideas, under the command of Kevin Feige. If before the studios practically did not bet on superhero films, ten years ago this reality changed completely when we saw ""Iron Man (2008)"" debut in theaters around the world, beginning a wide, complex and detailed shared universe, which gave life to characters that fans so longed to see transported to the cinema and becoming acquainted with others not so popular even among comic book fans. There were three phases that became known as the ""Infinity Saga"", in which we became intimate with Iron Homme, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange.Filmed simultaneously with ""Infinite War"", the Russo brothers and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely continue to tell the story of the previous film. Here, superheroes must deal with the events of the previous film, in which half of the people in the galaxy were wiped out at Thanos' snap, including friends and family of our heroes. Those who are left are still, for more than three weeks, trying to locate Thanos who entered a portal and disappeared, while trying to find a solution to reverse what had happened.The first fifteen minutes invest in revenge and the consummation of failure: an introduction. The next sequences, which make up a first, more melancholic, yet vigorous act in re-presenting characters and renewing the previous status quo, have an emphasis on the intimate, precisely what drives Ultimato as an experience: a great show on a colossal scale, but that cares about a dance, a feeling, a heart, a family.""Ultimatum"" gets it right by dedicating more than half its duration to intensify the hopelessness, mourning and disbelief that the characters and the audience were going through together. In that time, he takes the opportunity to strengthen ties between unlikely characters, such as Toby Stark and Nebula, and also to show how old friends, such as Natasha, Rogers and Barton, Tony and Thor and Bruce, led their lives five years after the events of the beginning of the movie. The characters have their own layers, monsters and voids, to add to the project itself, which is a mooring of several narrative arches, the sustenance of a three-hour cathartic work. Especially interesting is Tony's bow, living alongside his great love and his little daughter, being the counterpoint to Barton, who had his life transformed after the loss of his family, becoming a vengeful murderer who eliminates those he does not consider worthy. Meanwhile, Carol Danvers went on to help other planets that also suffered from Thanos' actions.After the presentation of the current situation of each of the heroes, it is when Scott Lang enters the story, who managed to return from the quantum kingdom, after the post-credits scenes that we had followed in ""Ant Man and the Wasp"". He then explains that the laws of physics and space-time do not apply to the quantum realm, theorizing that they could travel through time through the Pym Particles and the portal. From there, after seeing an old photo of him with Peter Parker, Tony ends the time travel equation and the Avengers, with the exception of Danvers, split into groups to return to the past and retrieve the Infinity Stones and that's when Marvel takes audiences on an unforgettable journey celebrating 11 years of their shared universe, revisiting films like ""The Avengers"", ""Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and even the controversial ""Thor: The Dark World"" .Banner, Rogers, Lang and Stark return to 2012, during Loki's invasion of New York, to retrieve the Tesseract, Loki's scepter and the Eye of Agamotto. They also end up going to 1970 at the S.H.I.E.L.D. in Lehigh to get another version of the Tesseract, which was being tested by the military and to get more particles from Hank Pym, who had just invented them. Meanwhile, Thor and Rocket return to Asgard in 2013 to extract Jane Foster's Reality Gem. Clint and Natasha return to Vormir in 2014 to retrieve the Soul Gem, while Rhodes and Nebula go to Morag, also in 2014, where Peter Quill is about to steal the Gem of Power. This whole time travel will culminate in the great final battle, after Thanos discovering the heroes' plan, where the destiny of the universe will be at stake again.The cast reaches the height of their characters' understanding, completing a whole development arc. In addition to the main cast, which is already extremely numerous, there are still several cameos from great actors and actresses who showed up in previous productions. Robert Redford, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Tilda Swinton, Natalie Portman, William Hurt, are just a few of those names, and some of them literally go silent and leave quietly.With a million dollar budget of US $ 356 million, the film justifies the use of every penny and obviously will not have any difficulty in recovering and sometimes exceeding the high amount invested. They are effects used for the rejuvenation of characters, the construction of scenarios from different eras and worlds, dozens of intergalactic beings from the most different backgrounds and visual effects of a scale and perfection rarely seen. Not for nothing, ""Ultimatum"" was nominated for an Oscar in the category. Few times have we seen so many characters gathered together, with several actions taking place simultaneously, and everything wonderfully orchestrated by the precise direction of the Russo brothers, who manage to maintain a perfect unity and synchrony. The final battle against Thanos that takes up almost the entire last hour of the three that lasts the film, will be remembered as one of the biggest and most spectacular in the history of cinema. There, we can see the full potential of all the heroes presented by the MCU in these years should be a delight for fans of the universe. Not to mention the emotional and beautifully post-battle scenes that tie up all the last loose ends of the Infinity Saga. The audience is in tears. And it is not a daydream or exaggeration.The soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, responsible for the famous Avengers theme, composed for the 2012 film, is once again perfect, elevating drama, melancholy and epic action to the tenth power. In the musical part, ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"", by Traffic, ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"", by The Kinks, ""Doom and Gloom"" by the Rolling Stones and ""Hey Lawdy Mama"", by Steppenwolf are some of the songs that are present. The production designer of the always competent Charles Wood and photography by Trent Opaloch, who uses and abuses the darkest filters that give the greatest degree of drama and pessimism that guide much of the feature film are used with mastery.Throughout the film, the Russo brothers think millimetrically about each scene, sometimes to make the audience cry, sometimes to laugh and sometimes to cheer for the heroes in their battles. As well as the conclusion of the saga ""Harry Potter"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"", the great megalomaniac of ""Ultimatum"" will remain in the minds of the moviegoers as one of those epic films that practically everyone has watched. And the end, still holds great surprises, some that envision a future of the Universe, such as those involving Thor and The Guardians of the Galaxy and the passing of Captain America's baton.""Ultimatum"" works above all expectations: it not only delivers a cathartic experience greater than Infinite Warfare, but it also establishes definitive positions regarding the MCU's destinies. The film proves to have been planned in detail by the studio's creative minds, who know more than anyone else, how to please their audience. Although ""Ultimatum"" seems to be the end of the Infinity Saga, phase 3 will officially end with ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"", which should still have consequences for this film in the life of Peter Parker, especially with the death of someone very close and dear to the hero."

And yes, here comes the CGI villain again.It wasn't for me.Captain America: Winter Soldier is still the best Marvel movie."
571,"May 7, 2019",1,"So, i loved ""infinity war""and I was hoping for something better, that would blow my mind. After 2 hours i was checking my watch, that bever happened to me at an ""Avengers"" movie. I went out of the cinema demandibg my 3 hours back. This movie is a 6 at best, i gave it 1 just to balnce the stupid high 8,9 rate."
572,"Jun 27, 2020",10,Goat movie. Your DC could never. Just keep you joker in the s.
573,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Amazing avengers ... best so farSo funny and full of action and suspense ... loved it 100%
574,"Jul 23, 2019",10,"This movie is incredible, I watched twice in theatre, This movie helps you to feel, Pain, Anger, Sadness, Happiness. The action scenes were another level even you can't imagine the last fight scenes.I miss you, Natasha,"
575,"Jun 30, 2019",10,"There is one way to describe this movie and that is satisfying. It is satisfying in the way that everything you would want to see resolved is resolved and even things established in other movies have conclusions/payoffs. There are too many standout moments to count as everyone will have their own favorite moment. I don't know if we will ever see something like this ever again from marvel, but it is a movie that must be seen if you have invested your time in all these characters. You will not be disappointed"
576,"May 22, 2019",7,"For me personally this film was just too darned long. As I sat watching it I suddenly realised against all hope and expectation that I was actually a little bored - a feeling I never got from its predecessor.Visually it's stunning (as you'd expect) and I can see how to a great many people it has the ultimate wow factor but for me it doesn't quite hit the spot.Personally I'm struggling to put it in my top 3 MCU movies.I definitely prefer Infinity War and Guardians Of The Galaxy and then it's a toss up between this, Civil War, The Winter Soldier and Ragnarok."
577,"Apr 25, 2019",10,Conflict of powerhouses. As good as Infinity Wars.
578,"May 8, 2019",7,Fascinated to see all the super heroes..but more surprises and high moments were expected
579,"Apr 30, 2019",2,"Seemed like 20 minutes of action at the most out of 3 hours. The film didnt need to be that long. The scenes that were meant to be emotional were executed poorly, didnt make me feel anything other than boredom. Seems all the 10 star ratings are just from marvel fans! Face it guys, it is a bad film. The previous avengers was 1000x better. The whole length of infinity war was about them defeating thanos, in this film it took them 20 minutes."
580,"Oct 26, 2019",8,"The movie didn't actually reach my expectation. But overall, the movie is amazing"
581,"Mar 17, 2020",10,"I would like for all 1 star reviews to send me a 10 star rated ending....People are trully so self absorbed these days, that they just Can't appreciate good work...And I am not a blind optimist aswell, for example GOT last season trully was bad, but Infinity war&End game (who is ment for people who have watched all the other movies and who dont dwell on movies being 100% comic book copies) is OUTSTANDING....the writing, the ending, jokes, easter eggs and throwbacks to previos movies(one that gave me some tears was ""Proof that Tony Stark has a hearth_from the first movie), presenting CHANGE, not stale characters for 10years who are afraid to change, because public is too naive, soundrtack, satisfying ending while still getting rid of few characters, Diversity( all sizes..rases..species and orientations(there is a scene, where Joe Russo talks about a relationship as a attempt to make Marvels universe more inclusive in the future)), character arch perfectly executed...shed some tiers, camera work good( could be better in the end fight), CGI-Perfect, logically a few issues with time travel and like 2 to 3 other small details and questions..... Overall (taking in consideration that you have seen the rest of the movies...) a strong 9.7.....Childish and unreasonable ""critics""...get a life."
582,"May 4, 2019",9,"A spectacular conclusion to the first three phases of the MCU. A ton of action and emotion makes this one of the best Superhero movies anyone will ever watch. While it is easy to get sidetracked by the hype around this movie there are plot holes that will make you scratch your head. Personally this movie is one of the best cinematic experiences ever. I laughed, I cried and I clapped."
583,"May 22, 2019",9,"Everyone and their mother has likely talked about how this film is over a decade in the making so I won't bring that up to much except to say that this film, like Infinity War, relies on that history. And this is a good thing as it has a lot of new content that builds off that foundation. Avengers: Endgame is filled with some shocking twists, heart wrenching deaths, and amazing cinematic moments you will never forget. If you even slightly enjoy the Marvel films, you cannot pass up seeing this movie. If Infinity War was daring in using most of its run time for villain focus and battles, this one is unique in how different its three acts are from one another. It makes the film quite re-watchable despite its length. And it all leads up to a finale you have to see to believe. Characters like Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Captain America shine like never before, as the writing for characters is incredibly strong in this movie. I would not say this is the best Avengers film. Its pacing can seem sluggish the first time around and some characters are treated as jokes more than they ought. However, the final act utilizes even its weaknesses to deliver on a satisfying conclusion. The only question left in your mind will be ""Where will Marvel take us next?"""
584,"May 12, 2019",9,"This was one of the best Marvel films ever, it was a great watch, and as someone who has complete invested into the MCU, I can say that this was a greta finish to a great film series."
585,"Apr 24, 2019",6,"Being a big fan of the Marvel Universe I was very disappointed to first sit through two hours of a very weird, boring and depressing Inception-like Movie. They had a lot of good ideas but didn't manage to make it a good movie. If you can just skip the first two hours and watch the ending. I was so pissed when the good parts came that I had a hard time really enjoying them."
586,"Jun 26, 2019",10,"Endgame is the pinnacle of what is possible for the comic book genre, the 10 year infinity saga comes to a emotionally satisfying end. And is easily one of the greatest films of all time, it's an experience you will never forget and a film that will never be forgotten."
587,"May 3, 2019",8,"After 11 years and 22 films, the Infinity Saga finally concludes with Avengers: Endgame. It's truly an experience to watch this in cinema, for the creativity, the emotional impact, surprises, and the fun this film brings. Despite the 182 minute run time, it is excellently paced and rarely has a feeling of dragging out for too long.However, I only recommend this film to those individuals who have watched most if not all of the films prior to Avengers: Endgame in the Infinity Saga. A causal moviegoer may or may not enjoy it, but someone who has followed the saga from the very beginning will most likely appreciate this film for it is the finale after all."
588,"Jun 20, 2019",10,This movie was awesome. I liked it a lot. Of course the actors were awesome as well. The story was great. 3 hours sitting straight... well it wasn't seem that much for me. The Russo brothers did this very good. Respect for them. This whole cinematic universe is incredibly good. At some points you will get emotional :) And this movie is just a perfect ending. That's it.
589,"Jan 12, 2020",8,Enjoyed the movie and liked it more when I watched it the second time. A little lengthy but has some great scenes especially for Marvel fans. Sad to know that no more Avengers movie! Gets a bit crowded with lot of superheroes at times.
590,"Oct 18, 2019",9,"The marvel delivers a epic finale to avengers series. The years of build up and introduction of new characters definitely pays off . The farwell to some epic characters will definitely hit hard to every loyal marvel fan. The movie had its moments of action, laughter , sadness , togetherness and mindblowing climax. It wont be wrong to say the climax way up higher than the actual expectations. Despite its long run time of 3 hours it stills feels less for such kind of conclusion. The movie had its share of flaws but that does not lets you feel bored even for second. There are movies which are applauded for its story and peformances in the very highly recoginzed festivals around the globe unlike them this movie is itself a festival filled with memorable characters from the marvel cinematic universe. They are the characters who have such an impact that they will remain in the hearts of people for generations to come. This movie belongs to more of scifi or fantasy genre which are far from reality but the presentation of its imagination is delivered in such a way that you get sucked into its virtual universe. There are many series , sequels or combined universe movies who have actually failed to live up to its previous installment. Unlike them marvel universe continues to get bigger better and blockbuster with every passing follow ups. This movie is highly entertaining and enchancting equally to the fans as well as beginners. It definitely deserves a perfect score as it does its best in its own genre and movies as such will be not played be on screen every year. It might not be a masterpiece looking through a critical view but its more of a memory for a marvel fan ."
591,"Sep 7, 2019",9,"There is more to story than action scenes. The movie was great, not as good as Infinity War but not terrible as people are making out. I understand the critisism but people rating below a 5 are clearly fan based blind."

You can actually feel your favorite characters coming full circle, redeeming themselves, pushing boundaries, and some even finally accepting and becoming the best version of who they are after a millennium of trying to be who they're supposed to be. Excellent callbacks, the one liners are brilliant. Great cameos.

Some of the characters were just not the hero's we know and love... after all this waiting around for the biggest battle in MCU history.. it was short and not that exciting... I'm a huge Marvel fan... and as a fan.. for me at least... Marvels big finale was disappointing.... but, I gave it a 7 being that it was fun, seeing all the hero's on the big screen like that was great and it had its moments... but still a let down.. Thanks for reading."
619,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Watching this was so surreal. It was unlike anything the MCU has ever seen, and I mean that in a good way. If there was an option to rate this higher I would"
620,"Jan 19, 2022",10,"In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight."
621,"Nov 6, 2019",10,"The amazing fight scenes and CGI aren't enough to mask the fact that the overall plot of going back in time to change reality is just plain stupid and lazy - and this is addressed to the writers. I did know that there was gonna be some time travel involved, but the way Marvel explained and executed it didn't too well for me. They can't get away with just putting it all in ""Quantum."""
622,"Jul 9, 2019",10,"I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I actually did, there were some scene I didn't even see them comming. I felt glue to the screen all the time, I even shed a tear, on thing I know for sure is that i'm a gonna miss a certain character.."
623,"May 17, 2019",10,An experience you'll gonna remember forever and watch again and again.

625,"May 4, 2019",6,"I thought that Endgame will blow me away, I was wrong. Infinity Ward was an amazing movie, it got 10 out off stars and it just a flawless masterpiece with no errors just pure art. Endgame is full off meaningless crap like the awful humor with cheesy one liners that just destroys the entire movie. It's not funny please stop it I thought while the movie just keep going with these lame and embarrassing jokes that just bored and got me mad at the movie to the point that I wanted it to end but it never did. Another bad thing is that Endgame is so predictable that its just a joke, you don't even have to watch the movie to know how it ends. But the movie did entertain me and it really got tearing up scenes that left me emotional and great character ark, acting and action scenes, but the problem is that there isn't enough of these elements to save the movie, and what's left is a big letdown. Good dammit."
626,"Feb 16, 2021",2,I fell asleep during this movie and haven't watched all the way to the end yet because it's so boring
627,"May 5, 2019",10,"To describe this movie, let's just say it was 'AWESOME!!'. The plot hole might be confusing for some people. But if you are a true marvel fan, you will be able to understand the storyline here. And yeah! NUFF SAID!!"

I really enjoyed the experience, and I am waiting for more from Marvel and I am excited to see what will they do with these characters."
630,"May 7, 2019",6,The Infinity War was 10 times better. The end game is just way to long and boring
631,"May 15, 2019",10,Marvel proved me VERY wrong. It was one of the best movies I have seen in 20 years. The links to the past and the empathy of the new stories made it 3 hours of pure pleasure. I bloody loved it!
632,"Oct 20, 2019",6,"I did enjoy the first half of the show. It was subtle and emotional. This was the first time ever in the franchise that they show us the capability of the actors they hired (except for Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland of course as they have been pretty much one-note. Well, it might be because of the script. They can still prove their ability in many other movies in the future).Then the action part came in. The central theme of the Avengers franchise. The time traveling was intriguing and everything, but seriously the end was a mess. That scene with force-feminism was ""cringy"" to its best. The death of the character(s) also felt forced and unnecessary."
633,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"First off, I would like to get somethings off my chest. I'll admit, in terms of a pure film I feel that Infinity War was better as a whole than Endgame. I found Endgame to be quite predictable throughout and I felt that it suffered more with Marvel's usual pacing issues more so than IW. While enjoyable, I felt that this film pushed the comedic tones a little bit too much for my taste compared to the previous film and disrupted the overall balance.However, this film still defied my already sky high expectations. Endgame did exactly what the title said.. it was the Endgame and boy was it a sight to behold. From the bombastic fight scenes and the intersecting complexities between each character, the film never ceased to excite. In many ways, what Endgame did right was it took the spectacle that was Infinity War and somehow took it to an even bigger notch. I found the film to be overall a lot more memorable than its previous counterpart. Throughout its 3 hour run time (which honestly didn't even feel like it, time felt like a breeze inside the theater), I felt that the film as a whole was much more compelling and contained more scenes that constantly put me in the edge.Such a statement is quite daring to make, but I felt that Endgame did an absolutely remarkable job in leaving so much distinct and vivid imagery. A film of this magnitude is meant to be a spectacle, an emotional joyride, and a bonafide table-setter all bundled into one roller coaster of a ride and such expectation was met tenfold.What I also loved about Endgame was that it beautifully ended so many prominent character arcs, while also establishing the foundations for the new era of Marvel films. I especially loved all the subtle and not so subtle callbacks to the past films in the series, which is quite a treat for long time fans like me. These are not the easiest to achieve in film, but the Russo Brothers did an amazing job in piecing 11 years of cinema history in order to project the absolute perfect finale to one of the most iconic franchises in the history of cinema.Overall, it's not a perfect film by any stretch but it's impossible not to give it a 10/10. Endgame is supposed to tie up all the loose ends and questions from the 23 other movies in the MCU, which it accomplishes beautifully. It isn't as fine polished and clean as IW, but it didn't need to be. Endgame set out to do the job and it passed with an array of flying colors. To all the twist and turns throughout the 11 years since the MCU was firmly described, I can easily say that one of the most epic nights of my life. Fans old and new fans can easily appreciate how epic of a film this is. Marvel knew what was needed to be done in terms of making the infinity saga happen and it was absolutely worth the wait. This era of the MCU is going to be surely missed and I cannot thank Marvel Studios enough for a hell of a ride. This might be the Endgame, but it has and will continue to be worth every second of anyone's time."

642,"Apr 29, 2024",10,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a monumental conclusion to over a decade of storytelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the film serves as the culmination of numerous character arcs and storylines that have been building since the inception of the MCU.From a technical standpoint, ""Endgame"" is a marvel (pun intended) of modern filmmaking. The visual effects are stunning, seamlessly blending CGI with live-action footage to create epic battle sequences and breathtaking cosmic landscapes. The action is intense and well-choreographed, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats throughout its nearly three-hour runtime.However, what truly sets ""Endgame"" apart is its emotional depth and character development. The film explores themes of loss, sacrifice, redemption, and the importance of teamwork in the face of overwhelming odds. It's not just a superhero spectacle; it's a deeply human story about flawed individuals coming together to do whatever it takes to save the universe.The performances from the ensemble cast are exceptional across the board. Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a poignant and memorable performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans brings gravitas to the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, and Scarlett Johansson shines as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. The entire cast, including newcomers like Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, brings their A-game, making each character feel fully realized and relatable.One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to balance epic action with quieter, more intimate moments. It's not afraid to slow down and let characters reflect on their journey and the choices they've made. These quieter scenes are just as impactful as the big set pieces, adding depth and emotional resonance to the story.""Avengers: Endgame"" is a fitting conclusion to the Infinity Saga, providing satisfying closure to long-running storylines while also setting the stage for the future of the MCU. It's a love letter to fans who have invested years in these characters and their adventures, delivering a cinematic experience that is both epic in scale and deeply personal."
643,"Jul 21, 2019",8,"Flicking through the ratings I saw a lot of 1/10 and a lot of 10/10. For me, it was like any other avengers movie, it was kinda epic. But still, 10/10 is a bit overrated.A lot of trends they inject into movies these days aggravate me. You can look at any superhero movie, Marvel or DC, since fortnite was booming it was somehow featured in the movies. The same can be said for political movements or protests/marches (LGBTQ-acceptance, feminism etc.). I don't mind them, but I don't need to be reminded of them by seeing them in every movie I go to watch.I think that this is the movie for a passionate marvel-fan, but it isn't the end of the world if you don't see it."
644,"Mar 23, 2020",9,"I'm a post-90s person, and I used to envy the ""previous generation"" : People who saw the final episode of the Star Wars Trilogy 40 years ago, and people who saw the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings series 20 years ago. The joys and sorrows of moviegoers are not the same, but now we have a common memory: Marvel Cinematic Universe. Thank you, avengers."
645,"May 3, 2019",9,Great work from all actors .. alot of emotions we laughed alot and confused alot and finally we was very happy for this work thanks alot marvel
646,"May 3, 2019",6,"I don't understand why people give 10/10 ? cuz of drama ? it's avengers not shawshank i expected a real plan against thanos but time travel ? it's like they tried to write a thanos plan but they failed so they said "" okay let's do time travel "". gg wp"
647,"Aug 4, 2019",3,"The previous episode was , ad least entertaining ...this one is just SO boring and sometimes so depressing ...3 hours trying not to yawn and more difficult , not to fall asleep ( Hopefully the fluctuation of the sound level between dialog scene and action one help me not to ! )PS : there's a good new , though , it's supposed to be the last one !"
648,"Jul 7, 2019",10,A Masterpiece That Will Never Happen Again..So Much Surprises And Fun And it is Really Emotional .. Omg Omg I really cant believe that they made it Awesome And Fantastic like that❤
649,"May 5, 2019",9,Bye bye Avatar! :) Endgame come to you! Your 9 year first place come to end next week! But this movie: Great end these 22 movies.
650,"Jul 7, 2020",10,"I did not grow up with American comics, but I still liked Marvel's Spider-Man, Hulk, and X-Men... and that is it. From DC I liked Superman and maybe Batman and Flash... and that's it. In other words, I am not an American comics nerd and I do not watch all superheroes movies.The first two Avengers movies su****. The bosses were lame and the superheroes were lame. But Infinity War introduced Thanos - finally a villain worthy of my interest. The movie was a 10/10.Now, Endgame, this was an excellent movie. Despite not being a superheroes nerd, I truly enjoyed this film and thought it was made expertly. How the hel* did this not get a lot of Oscar nominations and some Oscar wins? How the hel* did Parasite win best picture, director, and why did Endgame not even get nominated for best cinematography and special effects? Crazy.Conclusion: amazing film. It was perfect. The final battle was of epic apocalyptic proportions."
651,"Apr 25, 2019",10,This movie was something more than just a superhero movie. In this movie we watch the will of superheroes after been defeated by Mad Titan Thanos. This movie portrays the best 11 years of the franchise in perfect way. Please watch this movie as soon as possible.
652,"May 1, 2019",7,"First off, 'Endgame' is definitely worth watching. It is hard to overestimate the cinematic achievements demonstrated in the movie. It pays tribute to all the plotlines that had been leading up to this culmination through the years. There are some exceptional and iconic scenes which will surely command admiration of many Marvel fans to come.There are moments to rejoice, there are moments to cry, there are moments to laugh, there are moments to appreciate the fact that you are a contemporary of the people involved in bringing this whole universe to life and that you can experience all this first-hand.Judging the film by its own merits, however, is a different story. It felt like the directors wanted to seize this 'last' chance and do homage to so many characters and so many things that in the end we are left with this motley crew of multiple episodes and actions stuffed in one wannabe epic finale.With all its charge and glory, 'Avengers: Endgame' does not surpass 'Infinity War'. After that masterful fight on Titan, turning a black hole into butterflies bears no comparison to taming... a river."
653,"Feb 13, 2021",1,"This movie is awful. Shot very badly, the editing gives you a headache and doesn't show any movement of the camera. I'm not particularly a fan of the other avengers but this is a total bore all the time except the last quarter of an hour where there is action but thinking about it even the ending is stupid."
654,"May 5, 2019",10,"Great story, phenomenal actors, amazing cgi and cinematography, awesome battles."
655,"Sep 9, 2019",10,It seems arbitrary to review a movie like this. It's not a movie it's a journey. I watched MCU movies over 5 years before this and it is a great conclusion. I can't say you'll love it and it's easy to nitpick but its good. Seeing it in the theater was an experience I will never get again. Sincerely recommended.
656,"Apr 27, 2019",10,What a film been waiting and talking about it for a year and what a wait was perfect
657,"May 20, 2019",10,"What a wonderful movie that is the best marvel movie and the best comic book movie , no one can describe the movie greatness The movie was a mixing from ( laugh , cry and sad scenes) I'm so excited to watch the next of Marvel*spoiler alert*In my opinion that was the best end of the characters That a great end for a great man who was one of the reasons for the MCU 's success I love u 3000"
658,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Something like this movie never happen again Thank u MCU😀😀
659,"Oct 12, 2019",10,This film is a Super Movie but if you didnt watch other avengers Movies dont watch it. It full of wonderfull moments like the war of thanos
660,"Apr 29, 2019",9,"I really like this movie, I found a good plot and also a good final, yeah the people cry and more, but it is a serious movie with several elements which honored to its fans, It is indeed a super hero movie that will live in th mind of many fans"
661,"Jun 19, 2020",7,"The entire movie, as entertaining as it is, seems as though everyone involved was ready to be done with it all.The plot is unfulfilling. The inclusion of several characters seems forced.The action is satisfying, and everyone will find someone to cheer for.We're meant at the end, to weep for the grand conclusion. I weep for what could have been."
662,"Apr 29, 2019",1,"What can I say the title says it all, the director is really screwed up with the hulk he didn't even have a decent fight scene. The story it was kind of boring also fell asleep practically in the middle of the movie. This movie felt like a Hollywood director made it instead of a real fan the way it should have been made. And the CGI was horrible"
663,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"Too many endings and too much focus on the showdown, but of course we enjoyed every second."
664,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Wow! This movie will blow you away. You will feel every human emotion in this movie. It's a must watch!
665,"Apr 30, 2019",8,"Man i was sooo exicted over this movie, but it wasn't what i expected at all. I wish i would've liked this more than i did, i want to love this movie so bad but i just can't. Im givin it an 8 just because i love MCU and i liked the battle in the 3rd act."
666,"Mar 17, 2022",10,I just loved how they executed it so beautifully. I really enjoyed. Marvel studios killed it perfectly and I am hoping to see similar movies in the upcoming period.

668,"Apr 30, 2019",6,"This is an above average movie. I recommend you see it in theatres, but don't get your hopes up as far as it being an amazing experience. If you have a good crowd then it will definitely help in your experience!"
669,"May 5, 2019",10,Value for money....just watch one time on screen.......!
670,"Apr 29, 2019",7,The movie has a slow two hour start. The time travel thing was a bad idea. The end was good and saves the movie from receiving a six rating.
671,"Oct 15, 2020",1,Infinity War was a million times better than this trash
672,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"No matter what you think you can expect about Marvel Studios' Avengers: Endgame movie, the movie will be far from your expectations!Just try to remember the main characters in the last 20 movies before watching it."

674,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Every moment in this movie just makes you surprised, laughed, cried and in the end, it still brings to a close of an Era of MCU FILMS. Truly a Marvel movie indeed. P.S The best yet and will probably gonna watch the second time"
675,"Nov 12, 2024",8,"Avengers: Endgame is an experience that transcends the typical superhero film, and I can confidently say it left a lasting impression on me. Walking into the theater, I felt a mix of excitement and trepidation; after all, this was the culmination of over a decade of storytelling and character development. I had spent countless hours invested in these characters, and the stakes felt incredibly high after the gut-wrenching ending of Infinity War.From the moment the film began, I was completely captivated. The pacing, which some critics found uneven, felt like a deliberate choice to allow for character moments that were both poignant and necessary. The film takes its time to explore the emotional fallout of the previous events, and I appreciated the quieter scenes that allowed the characters to reflect on their losses and the weight of their decisions. It felt authentic and grounded, a stark contrast to the chaos of the battles that would follow.The humor was spot on, and I found myself laughing out loud at moments that felt both unexpected and perfectly timed. The chemistry among the cast was palpable, and it was a joy to see characters interact in ways that felt true to their arcs. The film is packed with callbacks and references that made me smile, rewarding those of us who have been following the MCU closely.As for the action, the final battle sequence was nothing short of breathtaking. It was a visual feast that had me on the edge of my seat, and it felt like a love letter to fans. The stakes were high, and the emotional weight of each character's journey was palpable. I found myself cheering, gasping, and even tearing up in moments that felt monumental.Yes, it's a long movie, but I was so engrossed that I barely noticed the time passing. The film's ability to balance humor, heart, and spectacle is a testament to the filmmakers' skill. While some may argue that it's not perfect, I believe it successfully encapsulates the essence of what makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe so special.In the end, Avengers: Endgame is not just a superhero movie; it's a celebration of a decade of storytelling, character growth, and emotional investment. I left the theater feeling a mix of satisfaction and nostalgia, knowing that I had just witnessed a significant moment in cinematic history. This film is a must-see for any fan of the franchise, and I can't wait to experience it again when it hits home release."
676,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Absolutely loved everything about this movie. It gave me everything I hoped for, and much more. After 11 years and 22 movies, this is the finale where everything comes together. Three hours is a long sit, but I would gladly sacrifice my ass to watch a bit longer. God bless you Stan Lee. Eat that DC."
677,"May 20, 2019",10,#watchendgame Do it Just do it please it's so good and although very emotional in good ways and sad ways you'll have an amazing time I promise you
678,"May 31, 2019",7,"The movie was ok, not willing to watch the 2nd time"
679,"May 10, 2019",1,"For me, very boring and the characters persona as they were before just ruined in this movie. I have greatly enjoyed every Marvel movie except this one."
680,"Apr 27, 2019",10,This emotional ending is perfectly balanced with the action packed setup from Infinity War. Marvel did an amazing job making an often-surprising and satisfying movie to tie up all the plot threads. There is nothing quite like the MCU and this movie displayed how far Marvel has taken each of its characters relationships throughout the last 10 years. Loved it!
681,"Apr 27, 2019",9,"Either bitter DC fans or people with short attention spans seem to be dissing this magnificent film. In order to get the most from Endgame it really does require you to have seen most of the previous MCU films. It's emotional payoff is probably the most rewarding of any film I have ever seen. It's funny, it's sad, it's exciting at the same time. It's not perfect, no film is. Perfection doesn't exist. It's an unattainable construct. However I truly feel it is the best possible version of the final chapter of the MCU any fan could have asked for. Nuff said."
682,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"This movie is the apex of cinema for my generation. They give you every emotion possible, love, hate, tension and the balance is just perfect. When you think something will happen you got bamboozled. The characters mix is perfect, soundtrack, action scenes and everything else."
683,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"Here we are at the end of all things. It's been over a decade with over 20 films leading to this, Avengers: Endgame. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and many, many more Avengers: Endgame hopes to bring the Infinity Saga as it is known now to a satisfying climax.It's a lofty goal but if anyone has a chance to pull it off it is Anthony and Joe Russo. These two directors have now become Marvel stalwarts thanks to their impressive skills with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and the adored Avengers: Infinity War.I can't go any further without stating that there will be spoilers in this review as I have to discuss some aspects of the plot so be wary going ahead. I will also state though I won't bring anything in that is from the third act of Avengers: Endgame.Plot!With the opening of Avengers: Endgame we see the team and the world is still reeling from the events of the ""Snapture"". There is however a glimmer of hope with the arrival of Captain Marvel (Larson) and some new leads on Thanos (Brolin). So the gang assemble (as you do for one of these big films) and head out ready to finally make Thanos pay and possibly save the victims of his action.Unfortunately, revelations are revealed and everyone is broken even more so than the previous battle. Fast forward 5 years and the world and the universe are vastly different. Our remaining heroes are scattered to the four corners of the universe and people are trying to move on. That is until Ant-Man (Rudd) shows up. Here we are at the end of all things. It's been over a decade with over 20 films leading to this, Avengers: Endgame. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and many, many more Avengers: Endgame hopes to bring the Infinity Saga as it is known now to a satisfying climax. It's a lofty goal but if anyone has a chance to pull it off it is Anthony and Joe Russo. These two directors have now become Marvel stalwarts thanks to their impressive skills with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and the adored Avengers: Infinity War. I can't go any further without stating that there will be spoilers in this review as I have to discuss some aspects of the plot so be wary going ahead. I will also state though I won't bring anything in that is from the third act of Avengers: Endgame.What did you do!? Avengers: Endgame is a love letter to fans of both the Marvel comics and the MCU. This means it has all the power of the 21 films behind it. Unfortunately, it also has several of the trappings that have been in each of those films that are amplified by such a major event film. For example, this film is one part a sequel to Avengers: Infinity War but it is also a continuation of Thor's narrative from Thor: Ragnarok. These two elements do not mix as the choices that the Russo brothers make in regard to Thor are laughable and easily could have been handled better. I can see where they are going with how Thor is handling himself after the events of both Ragnarok and Infinity War but they fumble here and Thor is not the only one who suffers. Hulk and Captain Marvel are also mishandled in my opinion. Captain Marvel is a plot device not a character in this film. Reports came out recently that Brie Larson filmed this before her solo outing and it shows in how the Russo brothers utilise her. With regard to the Hulk and Bruce, their whole character narrative is fanservice with no real depth to it. It's a shame because I was looking forward to where Hulk and Bruce were going. On the positive side Captain America (Evans), Iron Man (RDJ) and Black Widow (Johansson) are handled far better. With Cap and Tony, it's again further fan service but with Widow, there is a journey and it's impressive. It's a combination of great acting on Johansson's part and interesting narrative choices. In the end though there are two MVP's in Avengers: Endgame and it's Jeremy Renner and Paul Rudd. Their respective character arcs are emotionally charged and I loved it. They have quiet scenes that bookend the big brawls and it's greatly appreciated. On the topic of the big brawls there is a fair sense of scope and grandeur. The cinematography is decent and there are several moments of awe-inspiring shots that look ripped straight from the comics. They are splash pages in every meaning of the word. Avengers Assemble! There are many moments that fans will cheer over. Moments that will have them in tears clutching their significant other and that is wonderful. I myself cried at multiple points in the film but I am a sucker for these tropes. I can say hand on my heart I will cry at the end of Supernatural when it comes to its conclusion at the end of season 15 but I know that it's not all been award winning. This is the same fact for Avengers: Endgame. There are payoffs to many narrative elements for almost every character across the MCU and some of them are great but there are also payoffs that are just jokes and they clash with the tone of what is supposedly an end of an era. There's even a section in this 3-hour ""epic"" that comes across like a victory lap of sorts. Where the cast seems to be like - Hey remember how great this was? It's unfortunate and it felt like something out of a long-running television series.Whatever it takes Avengers: Endgame is a tough film to dissect. In one hand I adored the emotional beats, and several of the character arcs were engaging. However, there are so many issues. The clashing of tones, the misrepresentation of characters from this film as opposed to the last film we saw them in.There is no doubt in my mind that Avengers: Endgame is going to make a ton of money that fans will eat it up but it is by no means a perfect film."
684,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"The end of an era, Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war-aftermath reflection, & one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster history. 9.4/10.... 10 years, 21 movies, 32 heroes. The MCU as we know it just came to an end, and did so as epically as one could have possibly expected. Avengers: Endgame is one of, if not THE best and definitive Marvel film - and absolutely warrants the hype.The film opens into a desolate landscape post-Infinity War where our heroes are still coming to terms with the magnitude of their failure. Despite glimpses of levity-full psychological war aftermath reflection on topics like survivor's guilt and PTSD, I'll admit: I was mildly disappointed with the first act. Overly comedic and light-defused in tone, it's a bit discordant with the tragic events that just happened to trillions of life forms. It was also a bit anticlimactic having them find and confront Thanos so easily and early. However, these flaws are mostly sequestered in the first third (despite a weird intellectual Hulk and fat Thor just horrifying to watch), and are ~easily forgiven in light of what follows.Everything after the first act is masterful, dazzling fan service on a massive scale that will leave any Marvel or superhero fan speechless with their jaw-dropped. The middle act's time travel plotting makes for some incredible scenarios visiting past MCU films and having heroes interacting with their past selves. This was the magic of DC's Flashpoint comic arc, and although the film borrows its idea, it executes it perfectly. Thrillingly paced are the signature smooth-fluid action sequences The Russo Brothers are known for and exhibited ever since The Winter Soldier, as well as strong direction and intricate handling of such a monstrous scale of a story arc trying to beat Thanos before he even knows what's happened.The Avengers once again find solace in the splitting up of them into mini-teams leading to some hilarious and intriguing character combinations different from Infinity War. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye now Ronin, and the rest of the original 6 (plus a few others) are sent off into different teams and time periods to retrieve the stones, and it makes for some incredible entertainment value alone worth the price of admissions to watch. The Easter Eggs and cameos are downright legendary, showcasing what we already learned in IW: Anthony and Joe Russo are huge Marvel junkies who know and love the films/comics as much as the person reading this review.Thanos and his far darker tone. Thanos is also off scouring for the Stones while all this is happening. His pulling of the strings in things like sending rogues and strategically planting things to upset the Avengers' plans make him far more imposing than his rogue commando style in IW. Much akin to what Darkseid - DC's original titan/god that came out first and, yes, Thanos was cloned from - would be like, there's far more power in resources at your disposal and being able to fling them at your will. He also has a bite and far darker tone here, being pissed off The Avengers are wrecking his plans after knowing he won and promising to not only kill half of life now, but ALL life and start over again under his rule.Finally, the final act. I cannot even find the words to describe how legendary the final act of Endgame is - it might be one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. Like the Wakanda war on acid, this massive scale battle starting with the three most iconic Avengers against Thanos and evolving into a sheer epic warzone with every Marvel character you could possibly imagine, it will leave any fan speechless. And that's nothing compared to the heart-breaking ending with sacrifices that do the characters proud and have potentially-massive implications for the future of the MCU.Overall, while there are nits to pick from its ~anticlimactic humorous opening to its handling of Thor/Hulk to its lack of a post-credits scene (REALLY wanted an X-Men or Eternals tease..), Avengers: Endgame is an absolutely masterful film that delivers just about everything you could expect from it as a follow-up to Infinity War. The end of an era, Avengers: Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war aftermath reflection, and one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. It will be dang near impossible to wait to see what comes next.Overall Score: 9.4/10"
685,"Sep 12, 2019",6,"Pretty much 90% of the user reviews already say what I want to say so I'll keep it short. This movie was so much worse, in every way, than Infinity War. Which is a shame and it's not gonna get a low score because of how overrated it is, even though most people leave reviews saying how much they hated it. It just sucks that THIS is the ending to the decade long series we all grew up with."
686,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"I would like to assure all readers that I will not be including any spoilers from Avengers: Endgame. This film, according to me, is the finest comic book adaptation I have seen in the form of a movie. This humanised so many heroes that we are used to seeing fight Godly beings. Regardless of the long 182 minutes runtime, the pacing of this film is impeccable. Never does this film seem convoluted or exhaustingly long. However, a note for the non-Marvel viewers contemplating watching this film - this may be difficult to follow if you have not seen most of the previous films, at least the sequences in the middle of the film. For the fans, this really does pay off the 10 years of commitment you have exhibited and shown. Having seen the events of 21 films coalesce here is a privilege for me. I loved every moment and part of the film to the core."
687,"Jul 9, 2019",6,"I am not a Marvel fans so I hadn't seen many marvel movies so far . I think a good movie especially such magnitude like avenger 4 should let most people can understand content even I didn't see other marvel movies before. As a non marvel fans moviegoer , avenger 4 is not a good movie for the audiences like me . So that why I think this movie has wild room to improve because I still think audiences like me are not the minority"
688,"May 6, 2019",8,"It is made with great CG and it does not make me bored even though it runs for three hours. However, it is better to watch all of marvel films. I did not do it so I could not get some point."
689,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"This movie tries to give so much to so many, and in my opinion succeeds on a scale we haven't encountered ever before in the mcu. You will laugh, you will cry, and hard-core fans will definitely feel shocked at times. There sure are surprises, that some will love and some will hate. The Russo brothers made sure to change the pace considerably from what we are used to, since this film is about closures and farewells. I'm also fully convinced they did their fanfiction and fanart research to please most viewers with certain outcomes, and ended up presenting us with one fulfilling, tear-jerking three hours long rollercoaster parting gift. So go see this gift, and as we've been told in the trailers, enjoy the ride."
690,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"I think my problem with this movie is there was SO MUCH STORY to cover that much of the screen time is devoted to exposition and tying up loose ends- too much of the movie feels more like an obligation than an adventure.My other complaint is that there were some fantastic ideas presented in the film that don't quite play out to their potential. It still get points for introducing the ideas at all, but ultimately they left me a touch disappointed.But honestly, I can't imagine how they could've done things any differently (just like Dr. Strange said! There was only one way for this to end!).I won't ruin the ending, but I'll just say it's clear that ACT 3 is where the filmmakers put all of their attention, and it pays off VERY well.I think Infinity War is a far superior movie in terms of writing, editing, and overall fun, but this movie will still satisfy fans.Bitter sweet see the end of a 10 year era of movie-making, but it was great to be along for the ride."
691,"Sep 5, 2019",3,"More than 2 hours of drama and only minutes of action...or at least that's what it felt like. Also, tons of that annoying Hollywood epic type of music to make me consider muting it."
692,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"First I wanna say that i'm not the biggest marvel fan! I like the movies, But they're not the best movies in the world! I think the hype around it is way too much! Anyway, after saying that, it was definitly the best marvel movie till now! I got goosebumps, I almost cried sometimes, I laughed, I screamed. Eventhough i'm not the biggest fan, I still loved it, and Everyone have to see this movie"
693,"May 6, 2019",8,"A nice fun movie for comic lovers and families to watch. Entertaining. This film is really good but not great. It is much better than Infinity War and miles over that nonsense we saw called Age of Ultron. In spite of how good this film is, this really did not need to be 3 hours long. Maybe 2 hours 20 minutes, most of the beginning scenes were out of place and even some of the ending scenes. The action scenes were good quality, one of the best I've scene in a movie. The acting wasn't great, but good. Although this movie's storyline isn't The Dark Knight/Rises, Shawshank Redemption, or Empire Strikes Back quality, I am confused as to why the rating is a 9. The storyline is pretty average. Again, fun movie to watch, but not a movie I would watch more than twice. I've grown up a comic fan and have loved super heroes before they were considered cool, but don't expect this movie to meet beyond your expectations. It is all hype. That said I give this movie an 8 at the most."
694,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Just to give you some advice anyone who is thinking about seeing this film they need to watch the past Avenger films from the start.The storyline might be a little bit of getting used to but overall it is still a great plot for a Avengers film. After the end of Infinity War it was good to see how the characters had moved on and how the world is picking up the pieces of what had happened. When the sh*t goes down in terms of the action it really is on par and in some aspects beats Infinity War in terms of the diversity and the use of what each character is shown to do. Overall a solid Avengers Film
695,"Apr 25, 2023",9,"Avengers: Endgame is an action-packed and heartwarming conclusion to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga. The movie is a rollercoaster ride of emotions that will keep audiences at the edge of their seats from start to finish.The film features an all-star cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and more, who all deliver powerful performances that will leave viewers on the brink of tears. The action sequences are some of the best in the MCU, with breathtaking special effects and epic battles that will leave audiences cheering.Despite the film's intense action, it also manages to be heartwarming and filled with moments of humor and camaraderie between the characters. Watching the Avengers come together to fight for what they believe in is truly inspiring, and the film's message of hope and unity is one that resonates deeply with audiences.However, be warned, the film's ending is a sad one that will leave many viewers feeling emotional. While it may not be the ending that fans were hoping for, it is a fitting conclusion to the Infinity Saga and a testament to the incredible storytelling that has made the MCU so beloved.Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a must-see for any fan of the MCU or superhero movies in general. It's an epic conclusion to an incredible journey that will leave viewers feeling satisfied, but also a little bit sad that it's all over."
696,"May 5, 2019",10,"One thing I did before seeing endgame was to avoid all teaser and trailers and spoilers. With that said, I had no idea about what I am going in to see apart from what I had imagined in my mind as to what's going to happen next and I can tell you that most of what I had thought really did not happen that way. I would advise to watch a recap of MCU on YouTube and do watch Infinity War once more to refresh your memory. Just like infinity war, the movie starts right off the bat, moving story forward in a well paced manner. Since movie is three hours long they divided the movie into three sections, all sections well used:1. Gather the avengers 2. Make and execute the plan 3. Final battleThe movie is so well paced that the three hours just went by and there is not a single moment where you will lose your interest or get bored. The best part about the movie is the way how the past Marvel movies are connected to this one will be a surprise treat for you. Marvel has done justice to bring Thanos to big screen and given him two movie to fully show what he actually is capable of doing. He is no joke and you will see it in the later part of the movie. He is the baddest villain and the final battle has proved it.This movie was not all about action, as a matter of fact only last part of the movie is action yet still the movie manages to hold its audiences with a bunch of surprises and to the edge of their seat during final battle. The mission are also going to keep you tight on your seat. The movie is full of humor thanks to Rocket and Thor and Iron man. Surprisingly Hulk has some great comic moments as well.At the end the movie pays homage to previous marvel movies and their characters whose story ends with Endgame however they could be back anytime if Marvel wants them to. This is one in a life time movie that you will remember. Don't miss it and watch it in theater."
697,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"OUTSTANDING bittersweet end to a long cinematic saga brilliant performances by RDJ ,,,,,SCARJO,,,,,CHRIS EVANS .... Well done to all the cast crew and the writers and directors of this film for pulling this story of and giving us the best that the MCU HAS TO OFFER.... I only hope that i can continue to follow along for the next phase hopefully THE MCU WILL avoid the SJW crap, BUT i fear that, that is where we are heading its been a wild ride and this might be my last stop."
698,"May 11, 2019",7,"While the film isn't perfect I couldn't help but pump my fist and squirm in my chair at every moment. It's so exhilarating and exciting. I do agree that the time travel in the film does not obey its own rules at all, it still supplies the viewer with tons of fan service that they will remember for years to come. I left the movie satisfied with what I saw, a perfect finale to many characters story's."
699,"May 15, 2019",8,Honestly I found the first two hours to be pretty boring. A lot of it seemed unnecessary and drawn out to me but the final hour definitely picked up and was amazing. I was close to giving this a 7 but the end definitely had me emotional which never happens to me so clearly it had an effect on me! Great performances by RDJ and Chris Evans. Not so great performance by Scarlett Johansson though. Everyone else was good although Thor's issues were kind of too much after a while.
700,"May 9, 2019",7,"Pandering to the politics of the day created one shot during the epic battle of ALL of the female characters that this female found trite and patronizing. 2 or more other major plot decisions are also a betrayal of the fandom by surrendering to the tyranny of identity politics. Uneven and contradictory handling of the characters and plot decisions created a long list of plot holes and distractions .... compare Spiderman's friend and Ant Man's daughter. There are touching and heartfelt moments ... happy and sad tears shed. Sadly, those are diminished by the distractions of the plot issues. The 7 rating was a nod to the efforts of the players, despite the machinations of the script."
701,"May 1, 2019",1,None of the rules presented in movie makes sense. Bad movie in regards to final conclusion
702,"Jan 10, 2025",10,"Whether it's dislike, dislike, or dislike, the familiar Marvel universe has come to an end. Perhaps earlier, when a single player movie suddenly went viral and Mom didn't even know each other, or later, on the day when Grandpa Stan Lee set off for heaven, the puzzle like viewing experience changed from unprecedented freshness to a task like mechanical boredom. The game of finding acquaintances with each other changed from Easter egg like surprises to routine operations on the assembly line. The primary school fan black battle, the circle culture competition, Marvel became increasingly boring, but we had to keep watching because we all knew there would be an end to it. On that day, all the glory would restart, and all the happiness would flash back. What awaited us were heaven, Nirvana, the seventy-two virgins, or other things. Just like life itself."
703,"May 6, 2019",8,Entertaining movie. Mostly just fan service and weird plot holes. Go watch it. You've invested 10 years now. It's funny
704,"Jan 6, 2025",9,"Audiences were impressed by the movie's great acting and funny scenes, with many praising the performances of Robert Downey Jr.. and Chris Evans in particular.Some viewers found the movie depressing and slow-paced, with a sad beginning and ending, and a lack of character development. NEWS REVIEWS PEOPLE ALSO SEARCH FOR 4 of 6 5 of 6 RATINGS 78% Metacritic 5/5 Common Sense Media 94% when I am excited) and be naive (as always).Just came out from the screening of the Avengers Endgame (""Endgame"")! The journey had started in the year 2008, when Tony Stark, during his capture in a cave in Afghanistan, had created a combat suit and came out of his captivity. Then the combat suit made of iron was perfected and Tony Stark officially became the Iron Man!! The Marvel Cinematic Universe (""MCU"") thus was initiated. The journey continued since then and in 2012 all the MCU heroes came together and formed the original ""Avengers"" (so much fun and good it was). 21 Movies in the MCU and culminating into the Infinity War (2018) and finally into the Endgame!"
705,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"Well, this has been what we all have been waiting for quite some time now. 10 years in making, characters we grew find of and vast and complex storylines. They all have ended up to this movie. I wanted to watch this movie on the opening night and couldn't wait to get in. As someone who has been following the Marvel universe fairly thoroughly and watched almost all of the movies leading to this one multiple times, to be honest, I wasn't blown away. The problem for me was that while I was enjoying the movie, I couldn't help but to realize this is going to be THE last one, so all of a sudden I wasn't that impress with the way many scenes were being handled. Especially, when you compare it to some of the other Marvel movies which were fantastic. If I were to single out one problem, it would be poor writing. I don't know whether they had time issue or spmething else but the material is so weak and the dialogues are so forgettable and superficial that were robbing the beauty out of the fantastic visual effects and sound effects and acceptable directing and casting. There were numerous occasions I was literally yearning for a killer line by the characters to hit me write in the heart and lingers with me for the rest of my life but the magic was far far from there. It was weird in a sense that they have already had many splendid writings in the Marvel movies to this date but why the most important chapter (the finale) should be like this is truly astonishing. All in all, it is not a bad movie in any ways but for the folks who have been following the Marvel movies seriously or semi-seriously, you will be a little disappointed that why this potential has been wasted in this way."
706,"Jul 18, 2019",8,The end of an era. It was a good movie but probably infinity war was better.
707,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Sometimes I feel like some IMDb trolls purposefully downvote something to keep overrated movies at the top of the all time list. I don't remember a movie matching and exceeding THIS big of hype. It's a great ending to a crapload of marvel movies. Makes you want to go back and watch all of them again. Plus when can you remember the last time you actually weren't sure if a character was going to die or if the good guys were going to win. If you didn't have at least a tad of doubt, you're in denial. Infinity War was a tiny bit better imo but they are both epic! Every movie is going to have plot holes if you sit there and pick it apart forever. Guaranteed you could claim plot holes in q documentary if you tried (these days i wouldnt doubt some idiot has). Good for you, you are so smart! No fooling you! Enjoy the entertainment and eat some popcorn. Let yourself enjoy life and dont worry about wanting to be pissed off/unimpressed all the time. My goodness. 10/10"
708,"Apr 30, 2019",7,"This is going to be unpopular opinion but after reading many of these reviews, it may not become unpopular. I will do the best I can to keep this spoiler free. There are obvious plot holes that will drive many MCU & non MCU fans nuts. Also, the movie starts off very slow and never really takes off for 2 hours. While there were emotional scenes & good actions scenes near & in the end of the film, it doesn't fully deliver its full potential throughout. Some of the superheroes barely get any screen time as well & you'll see why many people complain about Thor's obnoxious behavior. While it may to tempting to bash this movie to bits and give it a 5, I respect the ideas, acting, music, CGI, & work that was put into this. It definitely wasn't half a**ed but also wasn't completely solid either. Overall, you will most definitely be entertained and leave the theater with a smile on your face most likely but soon realize Infinity War is sooooo much better & more memorable due to its comedy, action, CGI, equal use of superheroes, plot, & the memorable Thanos. However, this movie didn't irritate me enough for me to hate on it. If you have kids tho, this movie will be a blast for them as my theater had kids hollering & emotional. 7/10 for my rating."
709,"Apr 30, 2019",8,This is a good movie but its not a typical marvel movie. i mean aren't you a fan of marvel because of all those crazy action sequences? but this movie have it less. this is more like a ending to the previous movies so dont except it to be as equal as infinity war interms of action but this movie have a lot of emotional scenes which you can get attached if you are marvel fan but if you are not then the first 2hours wont make much sense to you. as a marvel fan i can rate this movie 10/10 i even watched it two times but as a general audience this movie goes to either 7 or 8.
710,"Dec 22, 2019",6,"I was expecting something much better. The movie is way too long, it has a lot of unnecessary scenes. Some parts were actually boring. Captain Marvel is really annoying."
711,"Aug 23, 2019",3,"And i did like the previous ones. The first part was also not so good but this one was empty .... i totally don't understand why many people did like it. The aspects i usually like in this series is the humor and fun. This one didn't have almost any jokes and the storyline, is (as usual) pretty idiotic. There was not even any sophistication in the plot, just ... three hours of nothing. i don't rate it with 1/10 just because there were a few well done landscape shots...Come on, earth, stop spinning... i want to get off..."
712,"Apr 25, 2019",10,It's truly the end of the Infinity Stones Saga and it felt like as tears where pouring out of my eyes at the last scenes. Everything was tied up and perfect. It was brilliant. The movie itself was a roller coaster of emotions. Everyone was cheering and then crying on the next scene. It was crazy. But it was full of love and humane. It was everything it needed to be.
713,"May 21, 2019",10,I loved endgame (the first time at least) I think it was the best ending for the 3rd phase of the mcu. I'm really excited for phase 4 of the mcu already
714,"Jul 30, 2019",8,"Im not a huge Marvel fan, but i like to watch their movies, and after seen Infinity War, i can say, this was worst. The first couple of hours was just fill time and i wasnt enjoying that much. The last hour, with the battle and all the events, it trully become really good. So, a 7 for hour 1 and 2, and a strong 9 for the last."
715,"Apr 27, 2019",9,"This is a kitchen sink movie, in that you get everything but the kitchen sink in it! The three hours flies by mostly due to the fact that the action rarely stops. It's a movie filled with laughs and tears and goodbyes. A couple of scenes seemed shoe horned in to appease the folks clamoring for more ""Woke"" moments. Those scenes aside, most of this epic movie is solidly put together and wonderfully presented. Without spoiling anything, I was scratching my head at some of the logic behind science in the movie that goes against every thing any movie viewer has ever seen, but I have a policy of throwing logic to the wind on super hero movies. What's the point when you have people flying and teleporting across space. I've read this movie is a love letter to fans of the MCU. I'd agree with that, and would add that if it was a love letter, Robert Downey Jr. signature would be at the end, in the center, and slightly larger than anyone else."
716,"May 3, 2019",9,"Eleven-year wait is finally over. The Endgame hit theatres on April 24th, and the word ""hit"" might be the best way to put it. The culmination of a comic-book phenomenon called ""The Avengers"" is set to become the most successful film in terms of box-office gross, as well as be generally regarded as the best comic-book movie ever made.The story takes place in the so-called MCU, a universe where all the superheroes reside. Established 11 years ago with the release of the first film, The Iron Man, at that time tricky move has proven to be a resounding success and changed the lives of everyone involved. Marvel managed to build a universe so mesmerizing it has made fans always coming back for more. With the last film closing the chapter, it was Marvel's responsibility to do justice to this franchise. And it seems that they didn't disappoint.The film plays on a sentimental note, leaving viewers with a nostalgic feeling. This is done by referencing to the past movies, and even revisiting the old sets. Slightly less action-packed than the former Infinity War, The Endgame focuses on the journey of the original Avengers, but still, or perhaps because of this, manages to take many surprising turns. It is nothing new that the stories of some of these characters are coming to an end, but don't make this prevent you from going to see this film! The death sequences are dealt with graciously, avoiding overused clichés. They leave you feeling heart-broken, but also satisfied with the epic conclusion.The only think that I find to be irritating was the song repertoire. Although the songs usually fit the scenes in which they appeared, they didn't tie the story together, making it a little chaotic and inconsistent.All in all, The Endgame is an achievement in both, cinematography and storytelling, and is a must-see for every cinephile."
717,"Jun 6, 2019",6,Avengers: Infinity War better than this movie. A film that cannot meet expectations.
718,"Nov 28, 2019",10,"Even though it has some slow scenes, I was really moved by the character building, how the story was elaborately planned, and the heartbreaks that we had to endure along the way. I must say, it had an epic and emotional ending we never thought we wanted."
719,"Nov 27, 2019",9,We have been waiting for this for so long since Iron Man started and the Avengers were created. A masterpiece that has undergone a decade in the making.
720,"Dec 11, 2024",10,"The production was amazing and very interesting, credit to the actors and actresses for their brilliant acting and for the production for the world class setting. Such an interesting movie to watch, a fast phase movie that targets the heart and soul of the audience and hope that it will reach beyond their target audience as it is really worth it to watch and enjoy such great movie. No dull moments and no boredom just pure enjoyment you will experience by watching it. Either alone or with companion you will surely not be bored, so I encourage everyone to experience what I experienced and see it for yourself."
721,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"(No spoilers here) Avengers: Endgame is a triumph. I couldn't think of a more satisfying conclusion to this era of the MCU. It starts off slow, but still very interesting. The first two acts definitely focus more on character work than having a very tightly paced film that doesn't even allow you to breathe such as Infinity War. We start out with the main cast in a state of defeat and devastation from the events of Infinity War and let me just say, we get some great, great, great performances here. The acting in this movie is so freaking good! The first act takes the characters down some really unexpected paths. Some of them I was all for, but two of them (won't say who) I found questionable. Once the second act starts and they come up with a plan to undo what Thanos did in Infinity War, that's when things get REALLY interesting. They time travel back to a few past MCU movies and not only deliver nostalgia and great payoffs, but also gives a deeper understanding and a greater appreciation for these past movies. There were also quite a few ""Oh shoot!"" moments as well. The first two acts were great, but the third was freaking mind boggling! The set piece, the action, the scope, the intensity, the stakes, the jaw dropping moments, the raw emotion, it's all here and I could not think of a better final battle. Just wow! This movie does carry quite a deal of heavy moments and a couple of death scenes which are very impactful. A lot of people in my theater were silently crying at the end. I didn't, but man it hurt! My favorite characters in the film were probably the big three (Cap, Iron Man, and Thor). If I had to choose one, it would have to be Cap. The completion to his arc was just incredible. Poetic, sweet, and extremely heartfelt. Just brilliant. There are a few (and I mean very few) gripes/nitpicks I have with this movie, but the magnitude of this film's greatness effortlessly gobbles up those tiny little nuisances. If you're a person like me who has seen every MCU film, then this movie was incredibly rewarding. However, if you're going into this movie blind or only having seen a few years f the MCU entries, it's likely you'll get confused quite often and miss most of the great callbacks. But I think you would find that there's still a ton of fun to be had with this one.Sweet, powerful, epic, emotional, gargantuan, poetic, symbolic, deep, rewarding, shocking, unpredictable, satisfying, Avengers: Endgame is a movie that will most definitely be talked about for generations. The MCU is truly the Star Wars of this generation. My grade: A+"
722,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"If you thought Marvel couldn't top themselves after Infinity War, you're in for a huge surprise. And best of all, even if you read tons of rave spoil-free reviews (like I did before going in) you will *still* be amazed.Everything in this movie works: The directing, the script, the editing, the music, the acting, everything.Everyone will enjoy it, and fans will love it."
723,"Apr 30, 2019",7,"The first half felt sappy and chatty. I found myself fighting the Zzzz in this first half. But the second half felt like a time travel thriller (a la mission impossible team). The climax with the actual battle was good, like epic battles we have seen before from the Marvel Universe. I was disappointed that there wasn't an end scene. I have grown accustomed to expect an end scene leading up to a new Marvel movie so I felt jipped watching the ending credits and not seeing an end scene. I think it's like a 6 3/4 out of 10 and I rounded it up to 7/10"
724,"May 6, 2019",8,"When I saw Infinity wars I knew the next movie will deal with unsnaping and the defeat of Thanos. After a year of waiting I saw the movie like everybody else. The sense of loss and of losing someone is tremendous both aspects are very different from comic books storylines, but for a movie it is important. In this movie the action, pace, and exuberance of supers is very less and slow. The concentration was given to human emotions, hopelessness and consequent coping to hard reality. However, few things I would avoided in scripting would the way in which they solved the problem and the credibility of the description of such powerful stones. Mysterious soul stone, its layer, reason for sacrifice all has meaning except for the convenience of the plot. Time stone description in Dr.Strange has no role either. This entire movie fooled everyone by think stones have tremendous possibilities but it was just meant for the plot. That was disappointing. However it is master piece considering the way in which it was made. If I had to analyze and nitpick all the plot holes it would be full of spoilers. So I would say watch the movie and enjoy the epic conclusions."
725,"Apr 27, 2019",3,"I really liked all of previous Marvel films, but this one was a huuuge disappointment. More than half of the film was really boring, in fact nothing happened. Fight scenes looked like made by 10-year-old Marvel fan. All of the film seemed to be made out of fan theories and dad jokes. I'm sad because it's the end of this Marvel era and this wasn't the final I was expecting."
726,"Apr 26, 2019",10,I just going to experience best 3 hours in my life
727,"Nov 23, 2019",10,This movie deserves an oscar. If you haven't watched the movie yet you should watch it.
728,"Sep 3, 2023",9,"The finale ten years in the making, an ending that was able to provide on so many aspects from the last decade of MCU films, 19 films, 3 phases, and hundreds of characters and arcs all given their rightful exit. I think it's nice that you can always look back on the early MCU and have it end here, with the next two Spider-Man films also serving as a sweet epilogue/bonus.What I love the most is that each member of the original six Avengers had their own full circle moment, mostly. While Banner executed the snap and Thor had that important conversation with his mother, I felt like they had the least satisfying ending amongst the rest. Barton and Natasha's relationship came to a beautiful end with her demise, which provided a strong emotional core to the film. Tony and Steve were rightfully at the centre of this grand finale. In The Avengers (2012), their heated exchange is one of my favourite scenes in the entire MCU, and the way everything that happens after that between them links back to that is really satisfying. As you look back on the MCU, with all it's divisiveness and flaws, I think you can strongly argue that Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were beautifully written foils to one another in their character and actions.There is a lot of rushed CGI, especially with the time-travel suits, they do not look planned at all and are underwhelming. Some jokes have become really outdated, or never landed. Not as many impressive action sequences as it's predecessor, but the grand final battle makes up for that. The final Trinity scene is incredible, plus Stark's suit is gorgeous here. It's not as tight as Infinity War, but it still stands as a great finale filled with great moments and arc conclusions.It's true that there is an abundance of characters that the film has to deal with, especially trying to fit in every single one of them in the last act, but I feel like this film was able to do it's job as best as it ever could have, and is a conclusion to a feat In blockbuster filmmaking that many people may look down on right now, but will learn to appreciate in future years. Creating an entire universe through multiple standalone and crossover films, was bound to attract criticism, but in the end, Endgame was able to deliver on it's promises, and end it on a high-note."
729,"Dec 19, 2024",10,"*Avengers: Endgame* is an epic conclusion to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga, blending action, emotion, and spectacle into a satisfying finale. The film expertly balances the large ensemble cast, giving each character significant moments. The visual effects are stunning, and the action sequences are thrilling, especially the final battle. What truly stands out, however, is its emotional depth, with powerful character arcs and a poignant exploration of sacrifice and heroism. It's a triumphant, though bittersweet, conclusion to over a decade of storytelling, leaving a lasting impact on fans."
730,"Apr 26, 2019",8,"The ending of this great saga really reaches deep to tie up loose ends and make the ending a satisfactory, thirst-quenching resolution to what started so long ago-in a small cave somewhere-with a desperate Tony Stark and the birth of a hero."
731,"Dec 11, 2024",10,"The deaths. I sent out a tweet right after I got out of the theatre saying that my one-word review of this film is, 'ambitious' and that's because of the outcome of many of this film's main characters. At the end of the film, we see Thanos complete his mission of collecting all of the Infinity Stones, with the sacrifice of his own daughter and Guardian of the Galaxy, Gamora.In my favorite scene of the film, Thor sinks his new ax deep into Thanos' chest, and Thanos says through a wicked grin, ""You should have went for the head,"" and he snaps his fingers, just like in the original source material and destroys half of all life in the universe. Moments later some of our favorite heroes start reducing to dust and every single person in my theatre was stunned.There was a moment when fan favorite, Black Panther started reducing to dust and a person in the theatre audibly yelled out, cursing at the screen. This sequence which had no music behind it was extremely eerie and shocking in a beautifully vindictive way.A lot of our favorite heroes were just straight up dying and the movie ends on that cliffhanger. I called it ambitious because we don't know if any of these characters like Spiderman, Black Panther, Scarlet Witch and many others are ever gonna come back. I mean they will be revived because Spiderman and Black Panther made like 2 billion dollars and are both scheduled for second movies, but right now they are dead. Our heroes lost and that's never happened before.Even though this is called 'Avengers: Infinity War', this is Thanos' movie at its core. Marvel has been building Thanos for ten years and in this movie, he cemented himself as the greatest villain in the MCU, which has had villain problems in previous films. Josh Brolin, who voices and did the motion capture for Thanos brings an entirely new personality to the character from what comic fans are used to."
732,"May 23, 2019",10,So sad about some character's passing but this was an amazing watch and a great end!
733,"May 2, 2024",8,"In a fitting culmination to Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Avengers: Endgame delivers what fans have come to expect from the franchise: a spectacle of epic proportions wrapped in a familiar superhero narrative. Directed by the Russo brothers, the film ties up numerous loose ends while providing a hearty dose of entertainment.Picking up from the aftermath of Avengers: Infinity War, where Thanos's snap left half of all life in the universe obliterated, Endgame delves into the emotional turmoil that ensues. From Tony Stark's isolation in space to the vengeful determination of the remaining heroes, the film doesn't shy away from exploring the human side of its superhuman characters.The plot hinges on a time-travel element, an ambitious twist that allows for a nostalgic revisiting of key moments in MCU history. While this approach leads to some enjoyable and even humorous scenes, it also risks feeling like a prolonged exercise in fan service. The final confrontation, while visually striking, occasionally struggles with a sense of predictability as it's woven together.As the heroes band together for their final stand, the film's true strength lies in its ensemble cast. Characters like Captain America and Black Widow are given moments to shine, offering resolutions to arcs that have spanned multiple movies. While the film's lengthy runtime accommodates these character beats, there are instances where pacing becomes a concern, leading to stretches that feel a tad indulgent.Endgame excels in its technical aspects. The visuals are a treat for the eyes, as expected from a film of this magnitude. The CGI-driven battles are a delight for action aficionados, showcasing the superpowers and teamwork that have become the trademark of the MCU. Yet, it's the emotional weight that these battles carry that ultimately resonates with audiences.In terms of closure for Phase 3, Avengers: Endgame mostly delivers. It ties up storylines and arcs that have been developed over a decade, providing a sense of conclusion and catharsis. The film succeeds in offering a sense of finality, even though there are moments where narrative convenience and familiarity override genuine surprise. It's an entertaining ride with moments of emotional resonance, and while it occasionally feels trapped by its own legacy and anticipation, it undeniably provides a satisfying conclusion to Phase 3."
734,"May 11, 2019",8,"Great visuals and sound, solid acting and directing. A few problems with the plot, mostly surrounding the use of time travel (can't say more without major spoilers but it's mostly consistency issues). But overall a solid finale to the first three phases of the franchise."
735,"May 21, 2019",9,"One of, if not the best superhero movies I have ever seen. A must watch!"
736,"May 2, 2019",7,"Although it was a satisfying ending of the same characters in MCU, other important protagonists get sidelined in ridiculous ways. The ending was very emotional, but the road there was a bumpy one. The Russo's did not capture the magic they did with Infinity War, but I guess it was good enough."
737,"Apr 29, 2019",3,"Please don't explain rules to a concept and then break them in the same movie. We are watching, we aren't stupid."
738,"Sep 3, 2023",9,"The perfect ending to a series, in my opinion. Wrapped up most character arcs quite nicely, and the fan service was fantastic. Despite being a 3 hour long movie it doesn't feel that long at all, and this movie is a perfect sequel to infinity war and a great culmination of ten years of marvel movies. Marvel movies should have just stopped here, but alas they continued until they got boring and stale and no one cares that much about it anymore. Well, at least I don't. Maybe I've just moved on and grown too old for the superhero genre, but phase 4 was a disaster for marvel movies. It's like they took everything bad about Marvel and these films and put it into multiple shows and movies (with the exception of Spiderman: Far From Home which was quite good, but that was technically Sony and not Disney). Of course I know Disney would never have ended it here since they are a greedy corporation, but, still to me, Marvel movies ended here."
739,"May 21, 2019",9,"I'm not sure where to rate this movie because there's a lot of different angles to it. There are many plot holes. There is some humor that doesn't work as well as I'd like it to. I don't believe it's the best marvel movie. BUT... this movie is awesome. Make me feel something real from just a screen and you've achieved something and the Russo brothers did just that. Yes, the time travel logic will definitely not be accurate if you take the ""time"" (see what I did there) to dissect it, but this film did something pretty new. It connected over 20 movies into one grand conclusion that pays off better than any other piece of media that I've ever seen. Problems with the flick? A few sure. Any resentment? Pretty much none. You can't please everyone, but these guys probably did the best job they could and I love them 3000"
740,"Dec 6, 2019",8,Avengers INFINITY WAR was the best in the series so my expectations were low for the follow up. This movie dealt more with substance than style and is completely different than all the other Avenger movies. Definitely the most emotional movie of the series hence why they called it Endgame. Yes it's long but the characters carry the film much more than the action does. I enjoyed the film and may watch it again sometime. It was very good and delivered a fitting end but not the type of Avenger film you would want to watch again and again. That film belongs to INFINITY WAR.
741,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"#Genius is the only word that comes to my mind when I think about the movie. Moving the story from a crowd favourite #Thanos to superheroes who hardly use their superpower in initial 1hr is biggest narrative risk I seen in ages. From script to direction to acting to conclusion of main characters journey is done perfectly. I got a sore throat just by cheering (for cameos & for fan favorite scenes), so was the whole theater. To sum up if you're a #superhero genre lover, this is the Bestest product out there (It was for me)."
742,"Dec 23, 2024",9,"Tony had promised to return to his family and spend time with them, but in the end, he chose to return to the martial arts world because of his responsibility and mission, and because 'I am Iron Man'. The American team once missed their date with Carter and the 70 years they spent with him. Later, they attended Carter's funeral and personally escorted their beloved to the road, thanking the director for giving him a perfect ending. Black Widow is noble, heroic, brave, fearless, and ranks alongside Iron Man as the greatest Avenger. Thor bid farewell to his mother and Tony shook hands with his father to make peace, which brought tears to one's eyes. The American team made up for the biggest regret of their life; Banner and Hulk reconcile; Eagle Eye reunites with family; Black Widow has no family because the Avengers are her family... The ending is too perfect and too tear jerking. The scene of the collective return of grey heroes in Avengers: Endgame is magnificent and heart wrenching, with a scale at least five times larger than that of Avengers: Endgame. Especially the appearance of the Women's Federation was amazing, perfectly interpreting the power of women. After 11 years of development and 22 films, ""Avengers: Endgame"" has come to a successful conclusion. To borrow Morgan Stark's words: Marvel, I love you three thousand times!"
743,"May 3, 2019",8,"This one is good but some characters are getting way too little attention. Like the other movies this one is a ""cinema movie""."
744,"Jan 1, 2020",8,"I was just wondering if anyone else thought that there are inconsistencies with the size of Hulk. Sometimes he seems a lot bigger than other times. Not just in this movie, but in all of them."
745,"Nov 21, 2019",8,"Avengers Endgame delivers something that is beyond imagination, something is fantasy of every comic book nerd or a cinephile. With extraordinary visual effects, brilliant story telling and top notch acting, avengers endgame delivers a near perfect end to a near perfect saga. the movie delivers every checklist of y nerd fantasy. The final act is the most mesmerizing pay off i have seen in the last decades."
746,"Oct 21, 2019",6,"I trully an not exactly sure how i feel about this movie. After the huge surprise that was Infinity War, i genuinely didn't know if they could do something to top that movie. And... they didn't. Don't get me wrong Avengers: Endgame is a very fun movie that tries to be more serious than regular Marvel movies and just like Infinity War tries to balance a lot of different characters. The ending is a great tribute to RDJs iconic Iron Man role and it does feel like the massive conclusion of a cinematic universe that has been building up to this movie for more than 10 years. However it is flawed in many apsects. First and foremost, the movie has too many plotholes and honestly the whole time travel thing makes no sense if you think about it for more than a minute (granted that always happens with time travel but still) (also Tony Stark straight up invents time travel in an evening). Thor became a proper joke in this movie, which is a shame considering he peaked in Infinity War. Yes, it made sense for the narrative but they absolutely ridiculed him. Also i expected a bit more than fat jokes. Speaking of jokes the humour is good in this movie, but a lot of jokes just don't land... at all. As far as other characters are concerned, Black Widow is in the movie just to die and Captain America going in the past to live a normal life was a horrendous choice, and something extremely uncharacteristic of him. The rest of the characters were dealt with preety well, i especially liked what they did with Hulk, since having him be just a smashing machine again would be boring. My biggest complain though is surprisingly the action, which i found supbar ! Especially the final fight was just a massive chi slugfest, which makes sense considering there where so many characters on screen. Also the cgi is surprisingly weak on some points! I personally would have preferred if instead of another huge fight with a billion different characters and useless armies we got a showdown between the original 6 Avengers and Thanos and The Black Order, while the rest were fighting off the generic army. Thanos also felt a bit less threatening than before and also a bit more stupid and a lot more reckless. And the Black Order was barely even used, for some reason. Furthermore, a lot of moments clearly happened just for the sake a fan service, which i didn't like at all. Finally, though i enjoyed the direction of the film, i found the score and cinematography to be good but extremely basic. All in all, Avengers: Endgame serves as a nice conclusion to a massive chapter of a franchise, which however features a plethora of flaws amd ultimately doesn't bring anything new to the table. I'll give this movie a 6.5/10"
747,"Apr 26, 2019",8,"Well, there's no two ways about a Marvel movie: all out CGI, rib tickling humour, emotions, a very minimalistic feel of a possible romantic link up, catchy one-liners - all offered in a close to a 3hrs movie (to get the viewer interested in each one of the characters is a task no human can be 100% successful at) - as expected. All said and done, it's well worth the hype, and the wait. I still remember the good old days (at the start of Ironman franchise) thinking Ironman is meant to do something bigger. Marvel fans: that moment has arrived!!The only thing negative about this movie is: Thanos as a villain has little to do, even in this 3hour long saga; all his powers seem pointless in front of the endless list of superheroes."
748,"May 3, 2019",2,"Completely wasting for time and money, I expect this movie will be the best Marvel's movie but it was the worst."
749,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"This is without a doubt the best,most emotional,sentimental,unexpected movie I've seen in my life It got me crying like a baby several times and smiling and emotional I mean wow what a way to finish a decade of making great movies,absolutely amazing"
750,"Jun 26, 2024",8,"""Avengers: Endgame"" serves as an epic conclusion to over a decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe storytelling, delivering a satisfying blend of action, emotion, and spectacle.

""Endgame"" masterfully balances a somber tone with moments of humor and hope as the remaining heroes devise a plan to undo the damage caused by Thanos. The plot is intricate, weaving together various storylines and character arcs, resulting in a cohesive and engaging narrative.Visually, ""Endgame"" is stunning, with impressive special effects and breathtaking action sequences. The final battle is particularly memorable, showcasing the scale and ambition of the film. The emotional stakes are high, and the film does not shy away from delivering poignant moments that resonate deeply with the audience.Overall, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a triumphant and fitting finale to the Infinity Saga. It honors the legacy of its characters while providing closure and setting the stage for the future of the MCU. It's a must-watch for any Marvel fan, offering a thrilling and heartfelt conclusion to an extraordinary journey."
751,"Apr 26, 2019",8,Not really expected that kinda of ending as it's superhero movie always gets good at end this doesn't; story and drama was good ; time traveling concept explained is confusing; little more action scenes was expected ; Already missing the lost heroes.
752,"Jul 29, 2019",10,Woooooooooooooow..... what did I just watched.... I was sad and happy in the same time. I really enjoyed watching it.... EPIC
753,"May 24, 2019",8,"This was the epic conclusion to 22 movies of the mcu and what a conclusion, the cinematography, the action, the emotions is just some of the amazing things in the best ever superhero movie"
754,"Apr 27, 2019",7,It was not the best but it was like ok the first half kind of got boring then after the interval it gets more interesting and epic
755,"May 22, 2019",10,"I have seen this movie about 6 times (including opening night) and I love it as much as the first time! I have just been scrolling through reviews and could not believe some of the negative reviews on here! It has been called boring and some posters here have said the positive reviews have come from ""sponsors"". No, the positive reviews here came from a devoted fan base that have watched 22 movies for over a decade and are emotionally connected to the characters and the storyline! This movie IS the best ""fan service"" to ever be created! I really do suggest you do watch this movie if you are a fan of the MCU and not listen to these pretentious ""critics"" who only like art house indie films and hate on everything made by a studio! If you are a fan of the MCU and have followed along the span of 22 movies and love the characters then this movie will run you through the gamut of emotions! I have never seen a more interactive audience in my life. Laughs and cheers at all the right moments and dead silence in the emotional ones. Not a dry eye in the crowd when the lights came on and no one was embarrased because everyone was on the same journey whether you were 7 or 57. My opinion may be biased because I LOVE these movies but most posters on here are down right cynical and will try to find something wrong with anything! I only post positive reviews because even if I don't like something it doesn't mean that someone can't like it and I don't want my opinion to sway their curiosity. Life is subjective in general but I try and only focus on the positive!"
756,"May 21, 2024",10,"Avengers: Endgame masterfully concludes a decade-long cinematic saga, delivering an emotional and action-packed finale that will satisfy Marvel fans. The film skillfully balances humour and pathos, offering poignant character moments alongside spectacular set pieces.Directors Anthony and Joe Russo deftly handle a vast ensemble cast, ensuring each hero has their moment to shine. The time travel plot, while complex, is well-executed and serves the narrative effectively.Visually stunning and emotionally resonant, Endgame is a triumph. It's a fitting tribute to the beloved characters who have captured our hearts over the years, and a testament to the power of cinematic storytelling. While perhaps overly indulgent for some, Endgame is a must-see for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
757,"May 22, 2019",10,This movie hits all the right moves and I couldn't have been happier with how they concluded this Marvel chapter.
758,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"For a fan who waited 11 years for this movie,Its a treat.Some are questioning about the ending but for a hardcore fan it was the most satisfying ending.Well done Russos, Brilliant writing, Masterpiece acting and justice to every character of the MCU.Some will be missed and MCU is changed now. Most epic end to The Infinity Saga. Love you 3000."
759,"May 22, 2019",9,"I feel like this movie really closed the franchise nicely. It's always hard to end an era, but this was a brilliant culmination of the buildup created throughout 20+ movies. Solidly concluded."
760,"Apr 28, 2019",8,"Well, I never thought I would be in a movie theatre where men and woman were crying in a superhero movie, but it happened. Robert Downey gave his best performance to date imho. Cheering, laughing, crying, and a good old fashioned round of applause at the end, says it all. A very good movie, I scored 8.5. I would definitely go and see it again, after I did I might give it a 9. Fitting finale to a fantastic franchise"
761,"Apr 29, 2020",6,"I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure. Time travel destroys any film...time travel doesnt exist in the physical world.."
762,"May 5, 2019",10,The movie had some bad points but mostly it was amazing also when iron man dies it's so sad
763,"Jul 11, 2019",8,"We have had a ten-year relationship with the MCU. It started with IRON MAN, moved on to Captain America, inserted young Spider-Man and even gave us royalty in Black Panther. So here we are ten years later ready to sit another three hours with our favorite superheroes. After speculating and scouring the internet for the clues the day has finally come. Avengers Endgame is here.The question is, was it worth it? A resounding yes. This movie was thoughtful, and action-packed at the same time.It opens with our remaining Avengers trying to resolute what just happened. One would think that the Russo Brothers would give us a movie filled with Sadness and Revenge, but that's not the case here. Thor still gives us strength and humor. Cap gives us optimism and Tony aka Iron Man finally figures out what's important to him. Dr. Banner/Hulk is still a mystery however Black Widow gives us a little vulnerability.Where does Captain Marvel fit, and will they ever find the other Avengers all those questions get answered?Some things to be aware of, the first half of the movie takes a slower pace. It allows the surviving Avengers to grieve. Also, the reintroduction of Ant-Man and Arrow are handled smoothly.This movie is an emotional rollercoaster at times. This movie is for us die-hard Marvel fans. The ones that grew up reading the comic books and binged watched all the other films in the MCU getting ready for this,We're going to say goodbye to some favorites but not before we are treated to epic battles and friendships are mended.Avengers, Endgame is everything we want from Marvel and more. One last Cameo from Stan Lee and one last time our Avengers face down evil. The three hours are going to fly by and leave us a little sad, but Endgame gives us a fitting ending.Scale: I give this movie a nine. Good things do come to those that wait.Diversity: It gets 8.5 superheroes do all come in different shapes and color."
764,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"*Spoiler free review*What can I say, I am just another die hard Marvel studios fan that happened to literally cry while watching the saga end..When Iron man first came out back in 2008 my brother told me there is this new super hero movie where the guy wears a robocop like suit to fight bad guys. Growing up hearing mostly names like superman, batman n spiderman I really didnt care about Ironman. To me it was just another movie that wouldn't even get past the first installment.Little did I knew it would leave such a great impact on me and my feelings. So strong enough to keep me at the edge on my seat and fill my heart with soo many emotions that I never thought I had for all my favorite characters.If you are a Marvel fan like me, I bet you really don't need to depend on reviews like these. Because there is nothing that can stop you from watching the movie, if anything you could simply read reviews to feel excited and joyful to see soo many crazy fans like yours who have grown with all our superheroes together share their emotions and experiences.I wanna write so much, but at the same time I wanna save your time so you could go and watch this movie already. Just like me I am sure you have plenty of favorites that you love onscreen, and I can guarantee you that this movie will not only make it more nostalgic but also give you a permanent reason to love them for what they are and what they stood for, and how they ended their epic journey, forever in your heart.After all, we are meant to lose people we love, how else would we know how important they are to us?What a movie, what a journey, what a conclusion, what an epic battle, what a fun ride, what an emotional roller coaster, what a heartbreaking moment(s), what an amazing performance, what a timing, what a dialogue delivery, what a beautiful celebration!"
765,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Hands down, the greatest Marvel movie very made with a fantastic ending to these iconic characters. Absolutely amazing!"
766,"Apr 26, 2019",8,"""Part of the journey is the end"" - Tony Stark. I was not ready for the end. This movie made me feel those emotions no superhero movie has made me feel before, it even tops the non-superhero movies. I was speechless, teary-eyed, and worried after watching the movie. I am worried and sad because I know that it will never be the same again and I can't digest this fact."
767,"May 30, 2024",9,"Avengers: Endgame masterfully weaves together the storylines of over 20 preceding MCU films, offering fans a satisfying and emotional farewell to beloved characters and narratives. It is a monumental achievement in filmmaking. It successfully delivers a conclusion that is both epic and intimate, honoring the legacy of its characters while providing a satisfying narrative closure. The film's combination of stellar performances, impressive action sequences, and deep emotional resonance make it a standout entry in the superhero genre. For fans of the MCU, Endgame is not just a movie; it is a heartfelt tribute to a decade of storytelling that has redefined modern cinema."
768,"Dec 4, 2024",8,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Avengers: Endgame. I watched it on Disney plus . The Movie first aired April 18 (two days before my birthday) in 2019. It has a runtime of 3 hour and 1 minute. It was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo. It was created by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The movie was loosely based on the comics by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Some of the characters was created by Joe Simon, Jack Kirby, Steve Englehart, Steve Gan, Bill Mantlo, Keith Giffen, Jim Starlin, Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Jack Kirby, Steve Englehart and Don HeckSummary: In a desperate bid to reverse the catastrophic events unleashed by Thanos. Following the devastating snap that wiped out half of all life in the universe, the surviving Avengers grapple with their loss and seek a way to restore what was taken from them.Review:-I appreciated the themes explored in the movie, particularly those cantered around sacrifice, friendship, and teamwork. The narrative underscores the significance of collaboration in overcoming challenges, reflecting values that resonate with many individuals. The inspirational messages conveyed-such as resilience in the face of adversity and hope amidst despair-struck a chord with audiences seeking motivation during difficult times in their own lives. I believe that the film's extended runtime caused certain segments to feel prolonged and unevenly paced, which ultimately led to viewer fatigue. This pacing issue detracted from my emotional engagement with pivotal scenes, particularly when contrasted with the high-stakes action sequences. However, I appreciated the pacing that allowed for meaningful character moments while still delivering thrilling action-packed sequences, making the overall experience engaging. Despite its serious themes, the film skilfully balanced humour with emotional depth, providing levity that enhanced rather than diminished its stakes. I appreciated how the incorporation of time travel sparked philosophical inquiries into fate, choice, and consequence. I found the gore in the movie to be visually impressive; some scenes appeared quite realistic. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue. I was happy that it told us what was being said when it was in another language.I admired how the film's cinematography skilfully employed a variety of shot types to enhance its storytelling. Wide shots effectively established the scale of epic battles and vast locations like the Avengers compound and outer space, emphasizing the enormity of conflicts. Close-ups captured pivotal character emotions, while medium shots balanced dialogue with surrounding context, creating intimate yet contextual interactions. Over-the-shoulder shots enhanced perspective during conversations, making viewers feel engaged in character dynamics. Tracking Shots followed characters through diverse environments, enhancing action sequences and scene transitions, particularly in chase scenes and complex battlefields. Aerial shots offered dramatic overhead views during large-scale battles, emphasizing chaos and strategic movements. Low-angle shots depicted characters as powerful figures during triumphs and confrontations, instilling a sense of grandeur. While high-angle shots illustrated vulnerability and defeat, especially when characters faced overwhelming challenges.I was impressed by the visual effects, particularly the realism and seamless integration with live-action footage. The portrayal of Thanos utilized advanced motion capture technology, enabling nuanced facial expressions and movements that marked a significant leap in how animated characters convey emotion, making him a compelling antagonist. The film achieved remarkable detail that enriched the overall cinematic experience, with CGI creating a sense of grandeur while maintaining clarity amidst the chaos. I especially appreciated the use of CGI in depicting time travel sequences and alternate realities, which were crucial to the plot's development. Employing cutting-edge techniques such as photorealistic rendering and advanced compositing methods allowed for more lifelike interactions between characters and their environments. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. I appreciated how the movie provided on-screen text to indicate our current setting and how much time has passed. The soundtrack and sound effects were particularly impactful, as they complemented the scenes beautifully.-I thoroughly enjoyed reconnecting with the characters, and it was gratifying to see them remerge throughout the story. I appreciated how the film revealed what each character had experienced over time and depicted their lives in a meaningful way. The inclusion of strong female superheroes and the depiction of women in powerful roles significantly enriched the narrative. However, I had reservations about a particular character's self-sacrifice, as it risks reinforcing traditional gender roles that suggest women must sacrifice themselves for male heroes. The character development was impressive, showcasing substantial growth and leading to satisfying conclusions for many. Thanos was portrayed as a compelling antagonist; his motivations were explored in greater depth than is typical for villains in superhero films, which enhanced the overall complexity of the story.-I appreciated the film's conclusion; it provided a gratifying resolution. I was pleased that it concluded with a voiceover. Although I felt a touch of sadness at the departure of certain characters, I am eagerly looking forward to the journeys ahead for the remaining characters in upcoming MCU films going forward.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 7.9 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself."
769,"Nov 20, 2019",9,"As a big fan of Marvel, end game cannot be better to me. However, the greater end game is, the more worry I have for future Marvel movies without Iron Man and Cap"
770,"Apr 25, 2019",6,"I do enjoy the ending but I am quite disappointed with Endgame's whole execution.It felt like a slap stick comedy rather than the dark Avengers movie it was supposed to be. I don't mind jokes here and there, like in Infinity War, but it was a lot of it, even til the point that I found it disturbing.Thor and Thanos was quite redeemed in IW but their portrayals here feels like a slap in the face. Are MCU even aware that Thanos was so well written that he has a fanbase?This isn't a worthy ending for Phase 3 and MCU as we know it. It was just OK."
771,"May 8, 2024",8,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a film that arrives with the weight of a culminating symphony, the final movement in a grand saga of heroes, villains, and the humanity they embody. It is a cinematic tapestry woven from threads of joy, sorrow, and the rich hues of sacrifice and perseverance.The film, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, is a testament to the narrative power that can be achieved when stories are told with a genuine affection for the characters and their journeys. The Russos have managed to balance the scales of spectacle and intimacy with the precision of a master watchmaker. The action sequences are crafted with an eye for grandeur, yet they never lose sight of the emotional stakes at their core. Each punch and blast resonates not just through the theater but through the hearts of the audience, who have spent over a decade with these characters.The ensemble cast, a veritable pantheon of talent, brings a depth of performance that is rare in such blockbuster fare. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark is the soul of the film, delivering a performance that is both charismatic and hauntingly vulnerable. Chris Evans' Captain America stands as the moral compass, unwavering and resolute. Meanwhile, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye bring a poignant humanity to their roles, reminding us that beneath the superpowers and spectacle, these are individuals with hearts and souls.The narrative itself is a complex weave of time travel and alternate realities, a bold choice that pays off by allowing for moments of reflection and character growth that are as surprising as they are satisfying. The script, penned by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, is a deft blend of humor, heartache, and heroism, with dialogue that crackles with energy and wit.The ambition of its storytelling sometimes overshadows its coherence, leaving the audience to grapple with convoluted plot points that can detract from the overall experience. The pacing, too, occasionally falters, with the film's three-hour runtime feeling its length in places where the narrative indulges in one too many detours.The reliance on the audience's foreknowledge of the preceding films can be a double-edged sword. For the devoted, it is a richly rewarding experience, but for the uninitiated, it can be an impenetrable fortress of references and assumed emotional investments.""Avengers: Endgame"" stands as a monument to the power of storytelling and the resonance of myth. It is a film that not only entertains but also reflects the times we live in, with themes of loss, hope, and the enduring belief that individuals can make a difference. It is a fitting capstone to a saga that has defined a generation of cinema, and while it may stumble in moments, it soars in far more, leaving us with a sense of wonder and a satisfaction that is as rare as it is deserved."
772,"Apr 27, 2019",9,"I have no words for how bittersweet this movie was. I'm not in the habit of spoilers so have no fear this review has none of them. I can say you'll be amazing, you'll laugh and of course you'll cry..but for me I'm kinda upset in a way like a bittersweet chocolate bar I really like but kinda I hate I ate way..lol. And I know these are fictional characters and I shouldn't be so invested but that's what Marvel and The Russo Brothers do..they have taken us on this journey with these characters and now it's like we're all hanging over this cliffside with them..not knowing where or how the journey will end knowing we probably won't looking away cause we love them. I just don't know if I can move on with the next phase.. theses dorks are my people and I think they outdone themselves this time."

Talking about this movie , it is phenomenal and on next level but if you haven't watched the other whole Avengers than first watch the whole series in a correct sequence and than go for this . The actors did amazing job , they literally gave their 100 % and it is perfect. If you haven't watched Avengers series than please go and watch because if you don't you're missing the classics and historic movies of Hollywood and I'm 10000.... % sure that you'll love it ."
774,"May 21, 2019",8,"This movie was set up brilliantly by infinity war. The suspense the ending and the direction was all up to the mark. The cast delivers perfectly. Some of the theories used in the movie create plot holes which are well taken care of. Some of the parts of the movie is not well explained. It is a lot to grasp at the first watch. I thought that Robert Downey Jr performed brilliantly. The movie clocks well over 3 hours, but in the end keeps you wanting more. It opens up a wide future for the MCU to take shape into. It lives up to the hype. I felt that some of the cast members deserved more screen time. Otherwise you can put it up well with the best superhero movies of all time. If not the best."
775,"Jun 3, 2019",8,"Strongly believe that infinity war was a way more superior movie, with way more memorable scenes and a buildup to an impactful ending. While endgame incorporates all the characters in the story, it makes me feel less emotion for any of them. It was not a waste of money, no doubt, but it felt like the movie was being carried by audience feels for individual characters more than an exciting plot."
776,"May 15, 2019",2,"My kids were very excited to see this but I was more apprehensive. Really, the film is far too long, just unnecessarily. Parts of this film were very boring and were an ideal time for a cinema snooze! It had so much more potential but directors lost site of their aim. Disappointed."

The movie has lot of twist that in sometime you can't direct.The character's emotion protrey is good.Beside the actor is pect and the story is good too.It don't have any strange event or reason to do that.After you watching it,you will still have lot of feeling you can let them go.Go to see the movie to have amazing experience!"
781,"Jun 17, 2019",6,"This film is no Masterpiece. The Russo Brothers phoned in for a relevant follow-up to Infinity War. The first two hours were incredibly dull and boring. This film was filled to the brim with Fan Service and not enough Original Story. The final hour was amazing and worth the price of admission. The movie could've been condensed and it could've gotten to the point sooner. The humor feels forced and lazy. The film was filled with jump cuts and reused camera shots from previous films. The CGI is well done. The acting is poor at points. Overall, this is an average film, with two-thirds of it falling under below average."
782,"May 2, 2019",10,Just wow. This is the 1st time I have watched a movie and everybody clapped at the end of it. It is one of if not the best movie I have ever seen. No wonder it is breaking records. I will go and see it again

784,"Nov 28, 2019",8,This film was good enough. Neatly ended the group of films. All these low ratings. Kinda baffles me as it was a well made superhero film. I suppose it's not for everyone.
785,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"I laughed I cried, I shouted at one point. I had my head in my hands. I had my hands in the air. I went back to the box office and booked again.One word...... special.See it to believe it, a masterclass in film making. And the perfect close to a decade of entertainment and a year of obsession and theorizing (and STILL being off the Mark.)"
786,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This is the only way this marvelous, compelling, heroic story could end."
787,"Aug 6, 2019",10,"Just like my headline says. Watch this masterpiece for the love of God! This and infinity war are on totally different levels to any other super hero film. And this goes one level better than infinity war, absolutely fantastic."
788,"Apr 28, 2019",7,"After a long time, watched a movie with high expectations. They were high not coz of marketing, but this finale had all the contents to make a masterpiece. Unfortunately one thing was missing and that was the story line. First two hours were long and boring. You can not make a movie by revisiting all old stuff again and that too in single movie. Time travel movies ain't meant to be actions ones with superheros playing saviours. When. You intent to make time travel stories, you should take some lessons from back to the future series. Back to the future series have been best coz it dealt with one. Good story line.In infinity stones, for time travel events marvel never laid any stress on repercussion , also marvel. Made fun of hulks character. People would have loved to watch hulk bashing thanos to some extent.instead he was made a wuss.Same thing happened with thor in endgame. One more superhero character degraded to pathetic levels.30 min fight scenes at the end are. Moment of glory.. Still it can't be matched with infinity stones as they have much better locations in last part rather than dull battle field in this one.In nut shell, a golden moment to create a great masterpiece has gone down the drains"
789,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Watched it in 4DX. Premiere morning. This film makes me happy, sad, gives me peace and anger at the same time. It's a new caliber of superheroes movie. 3 hours means nothing.As other marvel films, the sound, the effect and CGI is a top class. Story wise, yes we will find some minor loophole, and yes, it's argueable, but I can't think of any major plot hole that can makes me hates this film. Especially it's a film that conclude all previous films.If you feeling happy, angry, sad or peace, believe me we are did.. and that's why this film is amazing and beautiful. A film that truly 11/10. It's a no brainer if you think and feel the same as me."
790,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"It's 10 years of beautiful moments and memories marvel brings to us. Movie is full of emotional moments. Anyway, it's beyond ""film"" it's just life itself."
791,"Apr 24, 2019",10,This was the best marvel film I have ever seen and the action was off the charts I just don't like what they did to carol's hair at all.
792,"Apr 29, 2019",10,Just epic Editing was a bit extreme but it is needed
793,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Just when you thought they may not live up to the hype, Just when you thought they have already done it all and there's nothing else that's gonna surprise you, Marvel does it again. Absolutely the best superhero movie ever!"
794,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"After 11 years, Avengers: Endgame is a truly MCU's finest hour ! This will be the most satisfying movie ever had from the MCU, and the Russo brothers dedicated everything to gives this cinematic achievement as a celebration to Marvel's brand and an epic conclusion to Infinity's Saga.But with the #DontSpoilTheEndgame's trend, I suggest that you should go see the movie immediately ! The less you know, the fun and the best experience you'll have to this amazing film.For me, It is such a great big film as much as The Return of the King and Ben-Hur ! (Possibly, it might be Ben-Hur to this generation too.) And as much as a superheroes film goes, I says this is the best Superheroes film of the decade (or in 2010's) that could go along with the greatness of The Dark Knight.Thank you, Kevin Feige. Thank you, Joe and Anthony Russo. Thank you, to all the MCU's cast. Thank you, Disney. You guys just made a classic film for everyone and I hope Stan Lee proud on this great cinematic achievement."
795,"Apr 24, 2019",10,No spoilers at all just go and watch this immensely epic culmination to the saga. Truly breathtaking. Just wow.
796,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"It's impossible to watch a film of this much scale, history, cultural importance, and franchise-carrying characters in a vacuum. No other franchise has the balls, nor the emotional buildup that it carries to justify a 3-hour runtime in a world where those kinds of runtimes are limited to fantasy epics (Lord of the Rings) or old glorious 70 millimeter films (Lawrence of Arabia). I guess that's what best describes Endgame, it is a glorious and grossly satisfying epic, and one that will soon become a classic etched and immortalized in the cultural consciousness of a generation.If there's one thing that Marvel has done properly, its understanding how to do good on their characters. The MCU has thrived because it has consistently followed a philosophy of putting characters first. There is a reason why this movie broke pre-sale records, why there were cheers, tears and rounds of applause from the audience in each shining moment of the film. Endgame takes Marvel's character-driven storytelling to its extreme and most appealing. Infinity War largely proved how Marvel knows how to divide it characters, unite them all with one common threat and theme, and deliver a punch in the gut ending that had fans dusting their tears.At the start of Endgame, fans are at the same emotional headspace as their favorite characters who are at a loss for hope. Right off the bat, the Russo brothers as directors have put themselves in a corner that allowed them to find a creative way out of it. Together with screenplay writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the story feels more rich, poignant, and satisfying. It goes without saying that you shouldn't go into this film expecting a high-art, indie slow burner, it still flows and feels very much like a Marvel movie, but the difference is that it is more restrained. The film opts for quieter, relaxed, and introspective scenes between characters. Steve, Tony, Clint, Natasha, Thor, and Banner all get their moments to shine, and it's clear that this is the original six's movie if Infinity War was Thanos'.Each fan service moment feels earned, despite it being obviously shameless and pandering, it feels like the Avengers can justify showing off a little especially after 11 years of buildup. Nothing beats the collective gasps and thunderous applause you get from the audience whenever each iconic moment occurs. Endgame is clearly, unapologetically, and triumphantly made for the fans. Each scene, each line of dialogue and each callback is constructed passionately and with care. No arcs in the last 11 years were left forgotten and left in the dust.As an epilogue to the now titled ""Infinity Saga"", this film works best as the season finale of a long running cinematic television epic. If you see it that way, you'll understand the motivations behind the creative decisions that the filmmakers made. Each plot point may feel overused or something you've seen before, but the people behind the scenes know it and even acknowledge it within the film. It doesn't mean they are unmotivated, but rather the opposite, they use it to stunning effect for incredibly emotional payoffs that honestly feels like a miracle that they managed to pull it off.In the end, what more is there to say about this movie? Aside from its consistently stunning visuals, creative cinematography, coherent action set pieces, and kick-ass musical score, this film is all about emotion and getting the catharsis you've always wanted as a fan, a normal moviegoer, or as a little kid. Some people grew up with the MCU, 11 years is a damn long time and I'm definitely part of those who did. I guess this is what those kids in the 70s-80s felt when they saw Star Wars.Verdict: 4.8/5"
797,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Thanks for with me in my best 11 years. I love you 3000 times. Simply the one best thing to live in Earth as Human.
798,"Aug 3, 2019",9,"Wow, just Wow! This movie has it all and needs to be watched PERIOD!!"
799,"Apr 24, 2019",7,"SO GOOOOOOD it has every emotion in one sadness, happiness, joy, it has everything there were a few scenes that were a bit cringe but other than that a near perfect"
800,"May 1, 2019",2,"The plot was messy, and so vast, with so many amazing characters, who were all simply diluted into one giant mess of a movie. Didn't really find the humour amazing either."
801,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I am sorry if i have a bad grammar, i just want to make review for this amazing movie. i think this movie is complete, the comedy, drama, romance, action, that's all in one movie. i laugh much than i ever do on other movie, i cried 2 times more than i ever do on other movie. I give my 10 stars for you all, the hero who made my life not flat anymore.and for the record, i think the story is unpredictable."
802,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"Undoubtedly this will not get published or heavily downvoted but in the interests of fairness here it is.A decent film, certainly not what was expected (the trailer is very, very misleading, which is a good thing in this case) however some characters were basically ruined for the sake of humour or that they couldn't be shoe-horned into the already overflowing roster, also there was in my opinion two kinda inescapably obvious flaws with the story which I won't spoil because honestly, I don't need to, I could hear the people sitting behind me and to my right say ""what? How?"" So I knew it wasn't just me overthinking it. The film is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not a ""10/10 omg I cried and laughed and what a masterpiece"" film that some of these reviews are saying it is.It's better than most MCU films, but it's no Winter Soldier or Iron Man by any means."
803,"May 1, 2019",10,"Very enjoyable IMAX 3D experience! I love the quantum physics involved, very fascinated by it. A lot of funny jokes & devastating stuff. Top tier Marvel movie difficult to talk about without spoiling anything; definitely worth price of admission - love geeking out for a fun awesome movie!"
804,"Jan 9, 2020",8,"Some people said there's so few fights scenes and it's boring. But if you watch MCU whole, you know what is this all aboutMovie is just iconic. I remember how strong my heart was beating in the final battle. Everyone who worked on this movie did best they can. I gave only 4-5 movies 10 stars , and Endgame absolutely deserves it."
805,"Oct 2, 2022",10,"This movie is 181 minutes.Who cares?.Why not made it 240 minutes, I enjoyed every minute every second of this brilliant movie.I loved this movie absolutely did.I hope gwyneth paltrow returns in future as rescue I really loved her as the superhero it totally suited her.This movie is groundbreakingly gorgeous.It's also emotionally sad but also exciting.These actors are also very down to earth in real life and really nice friendly people.Gwyneth paltrow must return as rescue it would really look cool and awesome.A stand alone female avengers spin off would be brilliant with gwyneth as."
806,"Apr 27, 2019",8,Infinity war was way better. Infinity war was way better.
807,"Apr 27, 2019",6,"Redundant plot, unnecessary long, unexplainable events and meaningless humour!"
808,"Sep 15, 2019",10,"This movie is awesome! If you're a marvel fan you will enjoy this but then again you have probably already seen it. It's funny, emotional and clever. Yeah it is very long and most definitely could have been shortened but I just enjoy the characters so much I don't even mind."
809,"May 11, 2019",3,"This has to be one of the most overrated films I've ever seen, it was long boring and tiring to watch. The story was boring slow and at times just felt unnecessary. I genuinely don't understand how people can say it was a 10/10 film."
810,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Just oh my God. I wasnt ready for this. Every Mcu fan will love that movie
811,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"The almost 3 hours flew by with great writing and effects, and the change of the characters lives made it that much more entertaining - especially Thor! Better than I expected, and a wee bit better than the last film imo. 9/10"
812,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Endgame is the ultimatest MCU Movie i've ever seen. Love it. Awesome.
813,"Jul 31, 2019",10,"LITERALLY , one of the best movies i have seen in my entire life , filled with a tone of action and emotions . you will love avenger endgame . ' i love you 3000 '"
814,"Aug 4, 2019",10,Yes I gave this movie a ten ... like i gave to Good Fellas or Casino or Aliens or Terminator 2. Why ? Because this movie is one of the best actions movies ever... CGI ... Actors... Story Directors ... are incredible. Yes it cost 360.000.000 USD ... the most expensive movie ever ... but at least they made an incredible Superhero Movie ... Marvel understood from the beginning how to make an entertaining film. I like Zack Snyder but the DC Comics movies are just trying it to make it serious ... Come one we want fights and funny conversations like in the comics ... The Story might be not 100 % in line or believable yeah give me a break we are talking about Superheros here ... they can do anything :) I am now waiting for the 4 Bluray Box for the Avengers and the 3 Bluray Boy of Captain America ... For me it ended now .... Great experience ... and I think it will take mabe some decades before they can do somethng like this again.
815,"Apr 27, 2019",6,Poor character developmenta lot of unnecessary characters that barely have a lineweird pacinglast act was pretty much a reenact of IW where they actually win
816,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Shocking start and a very shocking ending according to my perspective. What to expect in this movie is lots of emotions, laughs and surprises. It's a movie to remember"
817,"Apr 24, 2019",6,Ehh it was predictable and the last one was better
818,"May 1, 2019",1,This movie is so long and boring don't understand where the hype is! Not any close to infinity war! Senseless! Please save your 3hrs! Trust me
819,"Apr 28, 2019",10,All i wanted from marvel thank you to all cast of endgame you're my true heros ♥
820,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Initially I was really excited for 3 hours movie, thinking what could have been the story. But to be honest, the story line gave me goosebumps. Endgame is the rollercoaster of happiness, excitement and sorrows. Each and every turn, there is something different. I enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed it to the pieces. Sometimes, tears of happiness and sadness rolled down.Can't give spoiler. It's a must watch."
821,"Jan 26, 2024",9,"This film concludes an era, both of Marvel and of my heart. The Avengers were a fundamental part of my childhood and raised me by giving me sources of inspiration that I would not have found without them. This film for its importance and also its beauty, is the best Marvel movie of all time. I'm just sad to think that it's all over, but I'm glad that you had the best possible conclusion, for what has been the best movie house ever, which has succeeded most of the time in confirming itself with great superhero films. Needless to say, without these actors would not have been the same story. Robert Downey Jr. Is Tony Stark, and for those who have followed everything from the beginning I think you will always remember him by the name Tony or Iron Man. Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Holland and all the others were also fundamental to the realization of a universe that is no longer only understood as cinema, but as a family. Thanos is one of the best antagonists in the film world, especially for his motivations. Three hours of pure show, fabulous direction, spectacular visual effects and well-told story. A spectacular closing of an even better cycle. I don't understand how many people think this film is not up to the task it was meant to perform, madness. Trust me, even if you are not lovers of Marvel or superheroes in general, this film is not only science fiction, but above all heart.Thank you Marvel.. Rating: 9.9/10."
822,"Jul 12, 2019",10,"This movie is all That I wanted from a movie for a long time im still on the hypetrain eventhough I am a couple of tv show episodes behind but I try to clear everything up, cant wait until future project."

824,"Apr 27, 2019",6,I got disappointed about Thor and Hulk. And the Directors of Marvel for making the Thor and Hulk too weak. The reason i went first day first show because to see Thor. Russo brothers is suck.
825,"Apr 27, 2019",10,I can't think of a movie that covers the scope of End Game.
826,"May 15, 2019",6,"I enjoyed watching the previous ones.Now this one is too long, 3 Hrs."
827,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Can't Say nothing it's the greatest Superhero movie of all time

830,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"It is absolutely the best....I can say without doubt...there are many movies in the universe...but endgame is one in a billion....action packed,emotional ... good story...full of humour. There's nothing like it"
831,"Apr 30, 2019",7,"It is a great movie, 3 great hours, but not great acting, there is no acting, just super heros costumes"
832,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"This is one over hyped movie that under delivers. Marvel really is comedy and lacks the darker tone of the DC universe. Some people like the light Marvel universe but it's really lost something along the way. You need to throw common sense out the window with the this one and Captain Marvel, wtf haha. Enjoy."
833,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"There are no words that can deacribe how well made this movie is. The CGI, the acting, the characters, the story.. everything about this movie is just.. wow!"
834,"Apr 26, 2019",10,No words. What an INCREDIBLE JOURNEY!! Go watch the movie as blind as possible.
835,"Apr 25, 2019",10,After disappointment with both infinity war which on 2nd viewing wasn't as bad as I remembered either and also captain marvel it was a mixture of nerves and hope they could cap it off properly and boy did they deliver the best 3 hours of film I can remember that absolutely flew by. The perfect ending to a largely amazing set of films. A truly mind blowing experience.
836,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I cried. I laughed. I was shocked. My expectations were blown away. Perfection, enough Said."
837,"Apr 24, 2019",10,This movie was a true experience. I enjoyed every single second of it. It was epic.

839,"Jul 21, 2019",2,I did fins thia movie highly unrealistic. There is no chance this could happen i the real life!
840,"Apr 24, 2019",10,It is the perfect end to 10 years of amazing film making!
841,"Apr 29, 2019",10,This movies is the greatest superhero movie to ever be created. Robert Downey jr. portray Iron man I couldn't see anyone else playing as iron man. This movie is very sad because it's an end of an error this has been a 11 year in to the making of this movie. I would suggest to watching this movie there a great story and excellent finishing
842,"Nov 3, 2019",10,"The Russo Bro's should be commended by what they brought to the BIG SCREEN! this movie is GOLD! everything about it is non-stop fun, emotional thrill ride especially if you have followed the franchise for years. The tears will fall but the smiles will grow bigger than ever before. Some say 3 hours is too long but it's not long enough, I could spend forever growing with these Hero's and the wonderful actors portraying them, feel like a kid again and wishing I was a superhero! Heartwarming in all the right places. 10/10 my favorite movie of all time!"
843,"Apr 24, 2019",8,Almost as good as infinity.. But hey.. You gotta see it 😉
844,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Some things that we already imagined happened, but there's much more to come"
845,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"The story line was mostly boring, the characters (banner and Thor) were embarrassing and I missed the funny dialogues."
846,"Dec 18, 2019",8,"I really liked this movie, but the plot holes. Wayyy too many plot holes and basically... with time travel unlocked they can do whatever now. Like, come on. Good idea but the execution was pretty awful. I still love the movie but I hate the billions of plot holes."
847,"May 1, 2019",1,I'm sorry but this movie was boring except for the last part. Infinity war was well balanced and every character had a role. Also had action from beginning to end. But endgame mostly had unnecessary talks or travelling here and there. Most main characters don't even have any fight scenes. Whole movie is focused on only 2-3 characters. Rest of the characters were in it like they just have a cameo. Should have made a semi team up film after infinity war and then Endgame with all the characters having enough screentime. Wasted opportunity.
848,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"""I am Iron Man."" The best heroism. The best end game."
849,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Just 'marvel'ous. Blockbuster movie making at its zenith. The first movie that has properly lived up to its gargantuan hype.If u thought the pervious entry was the pinnacle, this one will put it to shame. All thanks to the Russo brothers and the wonderful actors who have lived their characters. If u miss this movie, don't visit the cinema hall again."
850,"May 6, 2019",10,The star rating doesn't go to 11 and this film deserves it. Ties everything together beautifully. Great acting and a great story. 3 hours zipped by. If marvel movies are your thing you won't be disappointed.
851,"May 12, 2019",9,"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, Avengers: Endgame does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga"
852,"Jul 17, 2019",10,This movie has been candidate to the Academy Awards for best picture.
853,"May 5, 2019",10,This movie may not have lived up to many of your expectations but when you really get down to it and listen to the whole of the movies all 22 of them and then watch this you will come to see it's perfect it stands by its roots and also reshapes what we believe is possible from the marvel movies no spoilers bu here but there cant be life without death right.
854,"Apr 26, 2019",7,"I would like to start by saying I'm a huge MCU fan. I completely get why people love this movie! it's a fun, end to a adventure that has been a part of many peoples lives for a long span of time. It is a great movie however it escapes me how people can watch this movie and not see huge flaws with the it. The best thing I can say is stuff just doesn't make sense.*Stuff in shots that isn't there in the next shot. *Simple story explanations were not present. *overall the story felt bland actually.With that said, overall you will have a good time watching the movie."
855,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Amazing acting performance for all the characters. Realist CGI, fulfilling and not disappointing ending. Well played Marvel!"
856,"May 6, 2019",10,"I love marvel movies. They aren't always the greatest movies, they are usually really good, but they are always fun. To tie all the stories together, develop these characters, create emotional connection, and still be fun and entertaining is no small task. Lost couldn't even end a couple of seasons on an island. This crosses time, reality, and space and yet still is a wonderfully satisfying conclusion to 22 films. Wonderful. Simply wonderful. Though why am I writing this? Is there really someone deciding whether or not to watch the epic conclusion to these movies based on an IMDb review?"
857,"Jun 22, 2019",10,Just magnificently the best part is that I can do it for a bit of time to get a copy of your website on the whole thing about ww2 you can you take it down loooool you are you gonna come to your mum is the most beautiful sound of the day after day and I don't think I'm going on with my family in the area of interest to you and I know they have fresh air you have
858,"Apr 26, 2019",10,As a fan of the marvel universe comic and cinematic. Tears of joy filled my eyes as the credits rolled then tears of sadness that it was all over. Endgame. Was. The. Perfect. Ending.
859,"Apr 30, 2019",9,"Thanos (Josh Brolin) snapped his fingers while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet, and half of all life in the universe disappeared. That's how last year's Avengers: Infinity War ended and left us craving for its epic conclusion.One year later, we are finally in the Endgame. The Russo Brothers filmed this arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe back to back and reminds us of the ""snap"", as we sit down to witness what's coming. Unaware of the battle happening in Wakanda, a family is in for a surprise that will have some serious consequences. Not just for them, but for the entire universe that doesn't know how to move on.The surviving Avengers - Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle) plus brand new members Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and marvellous Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) set off on a mission to stop Thanos once and for all. Will they find Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) in time to join them on this quest? And if so, what if it all fails in the end and make things even worse?11 years and 21 films have been leading up to this chapter. Avengers: Endgame says farewell to characters that have been part of our lives for such a long time, tears are inevitable. Emotions will peak, because movie fans have sat in the backseat for such a long time and got to know these heroes as if we're part of the team. Plots will be wrapped up (even some continuity errors are being corrected, to make sure everything is correct). Everything is at stake and there is only one solution. This is it.Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's script knows just how to find that balance between science, drama and action. These guys know what they're doing and find the heart in the midst of all the heroism. The battle of Wakanda was just a warm up - you ain't seen nothing yet! The Avengers and all of their friends get enough screentime to be remembered with honour or to leave an everlasting mark on all of us. Our superheroes have some extra tricks up their sleeves to keep things exciting. Every one of them gets a moment to shine and the clash we witness in the third act of Endgame is one of the most perfectly constructed and visually mesmerising war scenes you will witness - maybe, EVER! There will be laughs, you will cheer and gasp and you will definitely cry.After Endgame, there's a whole new saga to start and an entire universe to explore. But for now, let's just enjoy the finale to our Infinity Saga and take one last bow to salute them. Thank you Avengers. We love you 3000!"
860,"Apr 25, 2019",6,"I remember ten years ago when I was a comic book fan and the whispers that were coming out about a Thanos Avengers movie blew my mind. Infinity War satisfied that desire greatly, but Endgame is a mixed bag. I came out of the cinema feeling rather underwhelmed.To be sure, the action is superb. The last half hour of action made me grin from ear to ear and it gave me a similar feeling to watching Return of the King for the first time. However, it was a long road to get to that point.The film is too long. Far too long. It carries far too much baggage from the last movie and drags its heels, which in turn creates a jarring tonal discordance from quipping-Marvel fun to apocalyptic moping. Stop telling me how important things are. I know. Show me why they're important.Another problem I have is the story. It never felt like I was watching one. Infinity War was a hectic race against the clock, Endgame felt like I was watching a board meeting of writers and executives discussing how they're going to tie up loose ends. This is a movie that serves a cinematic universe owned by Disney, rather than serving to tell us a story.Without discussing spoilers, the plot is far too convoluted. The all-powerful Infinity Gems created enough plotholes you have to ignore, but adding time travel to the mix compounds this even further. It would be fine if the movie just dismissed these plotholes, but it keeps harping on the precise mechanics of how the time travel works in the MCU over and over, forcing me to think about how it makes no sense over and over. I don't like thinking about plotholes but Endgame just kept reminding me of them. Combined with the length this makes a large amount of the movie rather a chore to sit through.You must think I hate this movie after that, but I don't. The positives are the ones that come with the standard Marvel movie, funny writing, excellent music, effects, acting and likable characters. I'm certainly glad to have seen it, but unlike Infinity War, it wears out it's welcome after the first viewing."
861,"May 5, 2019",10,"The movie was exhilarating, super fantastic, stupendous, I liked everything about it. Well done Russo brothers, you'll have ended the saga in a way that's very brilliant yet heart breaking. Phenomenal job, everything was directed in right proportions and where it has to be, full marks to the cast and crew of the movie and everybody else who contributed towards making this movie possible. Worth every minute spent in watching this movie! Thanking the Russo brothers again."
862,"Apr 25, 2019",6,"First 2 hours are kind of dull. I was expecting more frankly. Reckon it's predictable as well, the last hour was entertaining though."
863,"May 1, 2019",4,But I never liked super hero movies to to begin with and got suckered in by a couple good Marvel movies. Time travel is a such an easy lazy fix. Only interesting charter was the potbellied super hero that wanted nothing to do with any of it.
864,"Feb 15, 2020",10,"Before seeing this movie I was super excited, but a little nervous. I had no idea how they were going to pull off wrapping up a franchise this big, but they nailed it! I don't think they could have done better with this movie. It was thoughtful, every main avenger had an important character arc to wrap up their story and the fan service was done perfectly. This movie made me appreciate some of the other MCU films that I didn't like as much, like Thor the Dark World. I was stunned at some of the little details that they remembered and brought full circle from the other films. All the characters endings made sense and were extremely satisfying. Also, the final battle was by far the best battle I've seen in any superhero movie. This was more than a film, this was an experience. I will never forget seeing this movie for the rest of my life. It's one of my favorite memories. I truly don't think the film industry can ever pull off a feat like this again."
865,"Jan 21, 2022",10,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we continue from were ""Avengers: Infinity War"" finished. The Avengers with the rest of their allies assemble to reverse what Thanos did and restore everything.I have to admit that I was expecting this movie after watching the ""Avengers: Infinity War"" because I wanted to see what will happen next. So, I had high expectations by this movie and thankfully I was not disappointed at all by it. The direction which was made for one more time by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo was simply outstanding and they followed their successful pattern and way. For one more time the interpretations of the cast made the difference and their combination proved why was so successful through all those movies including ""Avengers: Endgame"". To sum up, I have to say that ""Avengers: Endgame"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it."
866,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Endgame is the best Marvel movie ever, that simple. Very funny, very emocional. Awesome soundtrack. And the last 50 minutes....OMG."
867,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"After seeing endgame, I felt I had to let this out It probably the best movie to date (and I'm not hyping)...it got it all -action, suspense, comedy, emotional...just about everything a movie can possibly have...keep in mind it's a superhero movie but it exceed its limit...it also the best MCU movie in my book and it far exceed Infinity War. Maybe the most exciting and beautiful part of the movie came up about the last 40-30 minutes and it's the best thing I've ever see in Cinematic history.Overall, it a 10 out of 10 movie for me I don't really have to recommend you go see it before you do...just avoid spoilers before seeing it."
868,"Jul 22, 2019",10,I'm a fan of sci-fi movies & following the marvel series I just enjoyed the endgame every second of it..
869,"Jul 30, 2019",6,"Well, I finally got around to watching ""Avengers: Endgame"", even though I already watched ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"", so I already knew some of the events that were to transpire in ""Avengers: Endgame"". And I am not really fond of the superhero genre, but I still watch the movies when given the chance, as they are usually visually fantastic and provide adequate entertainment. And of course with all the hype that ""Avengers: Endgame"" had gotten, of course I just had to sit down and watch it.First of all, the movie was long. A little bit too long actually. I did feel that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were taking their sweet time getting to the core of the storyline, and just dancing around the bushes. In my opinion, the movie did suffer from this.Visually, well let's just go with 'wow'. Yeah, the movie was phenomenally stunning to look at visually given the CGI and special effects. But of course, being a Marvel movie, then you'd have top of the line special effects. And it is the visuals that carry the superhero movies quite a long way down the road.Story-wise, then I felt that the plot and storyline portrayed in ""Avengers: Endgame"" was a little bit too predictable and too generic. You already knew the movie's outcome when you sat down to watch it. Of course, Marvel weren't going to kill off a heap of their most beloved characters. No chance of that happening. So there weren't really much of any surprises along the way. And the time traveling aspect of the movie? Seriously? That was just downright idiotic.What worked for the movie, aside from the great visuals, was the impressive ensemble of actors and actresses that made an appearance in bigger or smaller parts throughout the course of the movie. Thumbs up for that. However, I found some of the dialogue to be a bit too corny and felt that it was written for a young audience.Was ""Avengers: Endgame"" a fulfilling closure to the Marvel storyline? Hardly so. The movie, while being entertaining enough, felt a bit shallow, with parts of the story quite poorly written. But if you, like me, come to the superhero movies mostly for the special effects, then ""Avengers: Endgame"" will definitely blow you away.All in all, I am rating ""Avengers: Endgame"" a six out of ten stars."
870,"Apr 25, 2019",10,One of the most emotional roller coasters! So funny yet so sad truly brought an end to the first decade of the MCU
871,"May 3, 2019",7,"The film starts to fall apart the more you think about it, but the conclusion to so many wonderful decade-spanning character arcs are so incredibly satisfying. There's so much to like about this film."
872,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I hope everyone appreciates this movie for the piece of art it is. Everything that has happened in the MCU (22 movies) mattered. This movie blended all of the storylines into one arc beautifully. It has a perfect blend of drama and well timed comedic moments. Every character has a chance to shine and the cast delivered at every chance. It has a perfect ending. Of course the Disney/marvel machine will roll on. They are printing money at this point. But let's all take a while and appreciate the work of the entire team that made this happen for fans. I grew up wondering if I'd ever see this material on a big screen. I feel like a kid watching these movies and I'll always love them for that.So please, avoid the spoilers and see this for yourself. Enjoy it now and forever."
873,"Apr 28, 2019",10,I went to watch this film with high hopes and it did not disappoint me. It has the usual Marvel humor but at the same time the seriousness as plot calls for it.I'm not an emotional person and rarely cried watching a film but this one put tears into my eyes. It is by far one of the best superhero films.
874,"Apr 26, 2019",8,"No spoilers here!I'll keep it short and sweet, it's a solid film and I enjoyed it, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Would I reccomend you go and see it? Of course! You should just keep your expectations within reason."
875,"Jun 25, 2019",10,A must watch movie but only those who have watched previous parts will understand.
876,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"This is the best movie ever that i had seen.Must watch in theatre. Best experience ever. It's perfect , heart touching, etc (I can't write my expressions in words) #Dontspoilendgame #whatever it takes"
877,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"Avengers: End Game can't compete on its own against the likes of The Godfather, Citizen Kane, or The Dark Knight, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has never been about competing on your own. The MCU parallels it's own characters in the sense that it's strength lies not in each individual, but rather the sum of their parts. Avengers: End Game is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the seemingly untouchable Infinity Saga, whose 10 year presence has changed cinema forever."
878,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"To put it simply: One of THE most overrated films ever made.... I wanted it to be everything i'd hoped for, i wanted it to live up to the gargantuan hype, but unfortunately it falls short and in essence 'fails nonetheless' (to quote Thanos) The final fight was good, but again nothing more I do not wish to include spoilers so i'll say this: This was not EPIC Some people thought so But not us #DontspoiltheEndgame"
879,"May 12, 2019",4,"Endgame is such a bad conclusion for the epic Avengers saga. Everything sounds predictable and even boring, as the firsr 2 hours of movie is a non-sense fanservice for HQ readers. All the hype the movie had relied only on Marvel franchise, because the movie, at best, is mediocre, even compared to the previous one. There are a few cringeworthy momments to take note: ""professor"" Hulk 4th wallish jokes, the time travel machine itself, fat drunk Thunder God Thor and the worst one: ""She's not alone"" empowered heroines against the purple male patriarch. Unless you are a fanboy or fangirl, watching this will be 3 hours less in your lifespam."
880,"Apr 29, 2019",10,This is by far my favorite movie ever every one NEEDS to go watch it in the theater there is so much action at times andyou will not be able to get everything on a normal screen ... It's not comparable to any thing else.. I laughed i cried and even after over 24 hours . I smiled when the battles happened i loved it all for a 3 hour movie you don't feel it.. I'm going to leave it here because i don't want to go spoilery
881,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"It's hard to put into words my feelings after seeing this film. Endgame is an epic, unpredictable, and emotional end to the most impressive long-form storytelling in cinematic history. This film is captivating for its entire 3 hour run time, with every scene and piece of dialogue carefully crafted with purpose. The payoffs and callbacks to previous moments in the MCU are amazing and reward those who have been loyal to this franchise. Avengers: Endgame absolutely surpasses the massive expectations it had and closes the book perfectly on an unprecedented saga of films."
882,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Have to say the best film I have ever seen. If you are prone to needing toilet breaks in the cinema wear a nappy!! As you cannot leave your seat watching it. Russo brothers thank you for delivering in my eyes a truly amazing experience and I have never had my emotions on such a rollercoaster ride watching a film. This reminds me of what a cinema experience should be as knew not much about what will happen and trailers didn't reveal the good bits. It was an epic and enjoyable film no need to stay for post credits either as there is none
883,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Far surpasses the hype. Going back again as soon as possible for an IMAX experience.
884,"May 4, 2019",10,"Every penny worth to watch! <3A great and accomplished emotional roller coaster story. Got me into tears many times, and constant gave me goosebumps <3"
885,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Avengers Endgame is the culmination of 21 Marvel movies over 11 years and there can not be a better ending than this. What a befitting end to an incredible journey. The Dark Knight was the best comic movie ever made but now Endgame shares the top spot with it and it definitely deserves it.The Russo's have upped the ante with their last outing, Infinity War and raised the bar for this so high. Boy did they do it better this time. The writing, directing and acting is incredible. With so many characters and superheroes, each one of them gets a chance to shine which is not an easy feat but the writers managed to do it.This is a 3 hour long movie but I didn't feel bored for a second. Such was the writing and direction. It has drama, humour, emotions, kinetic action and visual extravaganza. No spoilers, but towards the end of the movie all the super heroes from MCU come together and it is an absolute heart-stopping moment when Captain America says ""Avengers assemble"".The movie is going to leave you laughing, surprised and shocking by some twists, posibbly gasping and screaming. The ending is gonna make you emotional but you will leave the theater with a satisfying smile.Kudos to the Russo's, writers, Kevin Fiege and the entire Marvel team for this. Just go watch the movie and you will not be disappointed."
886,"May 2, 2019",1,"Please give me back the 3 hours spent in the theater to see this.All plot is overall stupid, it's like sooooooo long... and stretched..To much hype for.. nothing actually."
887,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Just when all the fans and critics think Marvel can't make any better film than Infinity War, they prove us all wrong with this amazing flick. The 3rd act is absolute feast and do watch it in IMAX 3D. All the characters were extremely well written & performed. I literally cried in atleast 14 scenes. It was so emotional in some scenes. Do yourself a favour, and watch all of the 21 movies before to feel the emotional quotient."
888,"Apr 28, 2019",10,The most satisfying end to a saga that has captivated our imagination for the last 21 years.
889,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I watched the movie yesterday but I didn't give a review because I couldn't think of what to say, until now. Avengers Endgame is truly an awesome and perfect finale for the past 22 movies in 11 years. The end to such a grand saga couldn't have been better. The movie is epic and out of the world. The hardwork of the cast and the whole crew can surely be seen in the movie. The audience wasn't expecting such an amazing ending to the infinity saga. The movie has perfect amount of action, comedy, emotion and the flashbacks and the references to the previous MCU movies truly culminated the 11 years journey. The end of the saga couldn't have been better."
890,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Starting many years agoe this saga began, on a journey of true extraordinary characters and storylines. Not all of them were great but they all held a beautiful story to a bigger story.I can go on writing on all the wonderful and lovely parts of the film and maybe pick a bad place e here 'n there but it's not needed. This is a genuine and beautiful story on people we've had the joy of following for a decade. This is an emotional roller coaster that will brace every part of the viewer. If you're in this hero-worls then you owe it to the industry to see this movie. I did, I cried and I recommend you to see it as well, it's goddam amazing!Thanks for everything Stan. With love, Rob."
891,"Apr 25, 2019",10,By far the best movie I've ever seen. All the MCU films have been leading up to this and it does not disappoint! Go to watch this film before someone tells you what happens!
892,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Amazing film, a roller-coaster of emotions too just brilliant."
893,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"The movie is plagued by plot holes. I will not go over all of them but I spent over an hour after the movie listing all the plot holes to my daughter. The biggest and the most ridiculous one is that the Avengers had only enough Pym particles for one round trip each. Movie made a big deal about this. But towards the end, Thanos uses one vial of Pym particle on his ship with everyone on board. With thousands of minion creatures on it. With no special ""Quantum"" suit or equipment. You mean to tell me Avengers could've just got on a vehicle and teleport all together with one vial? And with Hank Pym back now, they can time travel at will from now on. Or go back in time to get more just like they did in the movie. This completely ruins the Marvel Universe.There also was a huge plot hole fail in The Last Jedi when Holdo sliced Snoke's mothership by going lightspeed. Which ruined the Star Wars Universe. And this rivals that plot hole. The Last Jedi was ruined by too many ridiculous plot holes.Their version of time travel is a big mess too. It says past and future is not connected and changing past doesn't effect future but there are parts where it shows the new past effecting the future. And they were making fun of Back to the Future."
894,"May 12, 2019",1,If u r a marvel emotional fan then the film is for you don't have too much expectations like previous marvel movies
895,"Apr 25, 2019",9,This should be higher up the top 250! It was such a great surprise! I've never see anything like it! It was such an epic superhero movie and I loved every minute of it! It has to be one of my all time favourite superhero movie and absolutely favourite movie ever! I can't believe the outcome though! There won't be anymore avengers movies after this!
896,"Apr 27, 2019",10,This can only be described as perfect. What a ride and what a beautiful story. It's simply the most beautiful masterpiece in cinema history.
897,"Jul 12, 2019",10,I love it It's a very good movie to watch I'm from Iran and I love thid movie I follow this movie from the first episode of it
898,"Apr 27, 2019",10,I cant talk much about this movie ...It was just too good
899,"Apr 26, 2019",7,"The most anticipated film of the year: Reviewing ""Avengers: Endgame"" (NO SPOILERS)Saying this film gives fan service does not even begin to scratch the surface, as it is littered from beginning to end with quips. humor, forced appearances and minor characters. While being a send off to the old and an introduction to the new, this film was literally the end of the MCU as we know it, making me personally fear for the future of the franchise. It's not a bad film by any means, but it also fails to live up to the hype and emotion promised, although my screening was filled with thunderous applause, laughter, and literal sobbing at the end. Endgame is sort of a mess, and the story goes everywhere until finally reaching the climax. The film is split into three acts, all of which go entirely different directions, the first act is somber, yet humorous, for no reason at all. The second act is slightly confusing, but brilliant, bringing us back to different moments remembered throughout the MCU, and the third act is an all-out battle, not filmed particularly well. As far as films that wrap up a series go, with the 3-hour plus run-time, most of ""Endgame"" falls into the extremely average category, as more character growth should have been realized and the full potential of the original six Avengers, minus a couple, was never fully realized. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Jeremy Renner stand out in their respective roles, where Scarlett Johanson, Mark Ruffalo, and Chris Hemsworth feel greatly under utilized. The more modern Avengers cast is fresh, for the most part, but we begin to see where the MCU has over-saturated the franchise itself, as some characters that are even in briefly are far too invincible for a Universe based in modern times. The conclusion of the film will bring tears to some, but it's the closing the original MCU deserves after 11 long years. See it in the theater. ""Infinity War"" was the superior film. 7.5/10"
900,"Jul 3, 2019",10,"This movie had so much riding on it, and it wins in every way, shape, and form. Avengers: Endgame manages to hold onto the comedy and drama the franchise is known for while being the most emotional film in the genre. In the theater there was an immense amount of crying, cheering, and laughing from the emotional opening scene to the absolutely epic and action-packed finale.Avengers: Endgame is easily the best film in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe and one of my favorite movies of all time."
901,"Apr 16, 2020",10,"I wait this film without any patience. I hope that it would be one of the greatest film of MCU. My hope became the truth. In me point of view, this film is great from all aspects of cinema. Firstly, the story is amazing, the screenwriters did the great work, despite of 3 hours, no moments looks very long or boring. Twisted moments happen in the right place, most of actions of characters are logical. The authors have big attention to little details and ""easters"" due the film. Secondly, the cast is awesome, so many characters of comics together were the first time in the history. Some characters' lines ends, and this finish looks great (Iron Man and Captain America). Thirdly, the visual effects is wonderful. So, it's one of greatest oan biggest film ever."
902,"Mar 13, 2023",10,"""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) is the final film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga, and it brings to a close the storylines of many of the franchise's most beloved characters. The film takes the audience on a journey through time and space, as the surviving Avengers attempt to restore order to the universe and defeat the evil Thanos.The themes of sacrifice, friendship, and the power of hope are at the forefront of the film, and the filmmakers handle these themes with the care and respect that the characters and their arcs deserve. The tone of the film is grandiose and epic, with moments of levity and humor to balance the film's more serious moments.The acting is, as always, superb, with standout performances from the entire cast. Robert Downey Jr. Brings a sense of closure to his decade-long portrayal of Tony Stark, while Chris Evans delivers a powerful farewell to his character Steve Rogers. The characters are well-developed and, for fans of the franchise, it is a treat to see so many of them on-screen together.The direction is top-notch, with the Russo brothers delivering some truly awe-inspiring action sequences that will have you on the edge of your seat. The score is fitting and emotive, adding to the film's overall sense of grandeur and importance. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the scope and scale of the film's epic battles and locations.The production design is outstanding, with each set piece and location looking like they have been lifted straight from the pages of a comic book. The special effects are, as always, state-of-the-art, and the film's final battle is a visual feast. The editing is smooth, keeping the film's pace moving at a breakneck speed, while the dialog is sharp and witty.Overall, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a fitting conclusion to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga and a love letter to fans of the franchise. It is a film that will leave audiences feeling satisfied and emotional, and it is a testament to the power of the superhero genre to tell compelling and emotionally resonant stories. This movie is exceptional and a truly unforgettable experience."
903,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"This is the best movie I have watched till now. I will rate it 10 out of 10. There was so much excitement so much surprise so much action and the last thing which broke heart, emotion. Only the real fan will understand how much it broke heart. But it was needed to get 10 out of 10. As it is spoiler free I can't tell anything more but one thing, I have watched the movie in hall print then think how will it be in 1080p blue-ray. At Iast I wanna say the incredible last sentence ""I am Iron-man.""❤💝💝❤"
904,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"Last year I watched Infinity War on opening day in theatres and was amazed by it. Of course it was flawed and those flaws did bother me but it was still incredible. I just watched Endgame and this film made Infinity War look like Thor: The Dark World.Endgame is a stellar film, through its spectacular visuals, charming characters, epic fight scenes and engrossing narrative. It is a film that shouldn't be possible. If someone told me about this film ten years ago and said it was actually great, I would have laughed in their face. Yet somehow a film of this scale, ten years in the making, was masterfully executed. There was a lot I expected to happen that did but there was tons more I never thought would happen that completely caught me by surprise which is what I truly love about this film.The first two acts were great, they drove the story forward and gave us some great character moments. The first scene in the film, gave me the first out of many tears that would shed throughout the film. Honestly I have never cried this much in a movie and I would have never thought this would be the film that would make me do that. However the first two acts were flawed, there were a few pacing issues here and there, some problems with the narrative in terms of developing some character moments and other issues.However by the third act those problems were completely forgotten. The third act was so grand and epic and was one of the best final hours I have ever witnessed in a movie ever. I would love to talk about it but I am keeping things spoiler three. Just know that you could never imagine how effing spectacular it is. I certainly didn't.The ending in particular was emotional, heartfelt and immensely engrossing. It was a well deserved pay-off to these last ten years of films and a great satisfying end to it all. Overall Avengers: Endgame is a film that not only surpassed my expectations, but is also a flawed masterpiece. To this day I would have never thought I would want to give a film this flawed an 11/10."
905,"Jul 21, 2023",10,"Title: Avengers: Endgame - A Cinematic Triumph and the Best Movie of All TimeAvengers: Endgame has undoubtedly transcended the boundaries of cinematic excellence, redefining the very essence of blockbuster filmmaking. This epic masterpiece directed by the Russo brothers is more than just a movie; it's a breathtaking culmination of over a decade's worth of storytelling and character development within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).From the very first frame, Endgame pulls its audience into a rollercoaster of emotions, taking them on a journey of hope, sacrifice, and redemption. The stakes have never been higher for Earth's mightiest heroes, and the film expertly balances heart-wrenching drama with exhilarating action sequences. Each scene is crafted with meticulous attention to detail, leaving no room for complacency.What sets Endgame apart from other superhero flicks is its unwavering focus on the characters we've come to love throughout the MCU's extensive saga. It's not just about flashy CGI battles (though those are undeniably awe-inspiring); it's about the human elements, the vulnerability and camaraderie shared by the Avengers, making their victories and losses all the more meaningful.The film's three-hour runtime flies by, a testament to its captivating narrative and the emotional investment audiences have made in the characters' arcs. Endgame skillfully ties together loose ends from previous films, providing fans with satisfying resolutions while managing to deliver several unexpected twists and surprises.It's impossible to discuss Avengers: Endgame without applauding the extraordinary performances of its ensemble cast. Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, and the rest of the cast deliver performances that are nothing short of exceptional. Their portrayals add depth and soul to the characters, making the audience empathize with every triumph and heartbreak.The film's technical brilliance is equally impressive, with seamless visual effects and stunning cinematography that enhances the grandeur of each battle scene. Alan Silvestri's musical score tugs at heartstrings, elevating the emotional impact of every crucial moment.Avengers: Endgame is not just a standalone film; it's a cultural phenomenon that has left an indelible mark on the film industry and popular culture. It's a cinematic event that unites fans from all walks of life, celebrating the power of storytelling and the joy of shared experiences.In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame has set an unparalleled standard for superhero films and stands tall as the best movie of all time.

906,"May 18, 2019",3,"A disjointed CGI mess. Too much going on to feel like a real narrative was going on. Very few laughs, didn't feel like it had much of a soul. Thought infinity war was a much more complete marvel movie."
907,"Apr 28, 2019",10,They should include the X-Men in their next movie.
908,"May 28, 2019",10,This movie was the perfect culmination of the past 10 years of story building for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The threads they have been weaving for the characters and their connections to each other. You take this journey with then and the time jump to 2023 fixes any future cinematic timeline issues moving forward lol.
909,"Apr 26, 2019",8,"I was super hyped for Avengers: Endgame after the fantastic Avengers: Infinity War last year. I always wondered ""How were they going to top it?"" so what was the result after sitting in a cinema for almost 3 hours? I came out a little underwhelmed, honestly. I must stress that I don't think Endgame is a bad movie by any means, it's just the bar set by Infinity War was so high for me that all the shortcomings and issues I had with Endgame made me feel like it was the weaker half of the story by quite a significant amount in comparison.One thing I really noticed in Endgame was the pacing and structure of the movie was all over the place. There were weird tangents in the story that didn't really go anywhere and were just used as a quick gag or fan service. Compared to Infinity War where everything flowed so smoothly, it felt to me Endgame's writing was quite sloppy in places. The jokes were not hitting quite as well, and characters were acting differently just for the sake of a contrived moment or joke to occur. Without spoiling anything, Thanos for example seems completely different in Endgame to what he was in Infinity War. There were just so many moments where characters were acting un-natural, that it was distracting.As for the characters and emotional moments, Captain Marvel honestly might as well never have been in this movie. She barely does anything. Iron Man and Captain America get the most screentime for a good reason and have nice conclusions. The Hulk feels toned down here alot and left to the sides. Thor is mostly comic relief here, so if you never found Thor: Ragnarok funny, you might hate him big time here. The others have shared screentime and you do see alot of characters in this movie. It does have a big finale feel to it, and there are many nice references to previous Marvel movies in there too. If you've seen Back to the Future: Part II, that's basically how the Time Travel stuff works. Just try not to think about it too much, otherwise the inconsistencies might annoy you.Overall, I still had a blast with Avengers: Endgame. I was never bored despite the lengthy running time. However, the reason why I felt a little let down, despite still liking it, is that re-watching Infinity War just the night before was close to perfection at telling that side of the story. The sequence of events, the humour, the emotional beats, and the characters all acted at their very best in Infinity War. Endgame to me, felt like a noticeable drop in quality despite the grandness and scale of it acting as a swan song to the MCU Universe. I'm not sure where Marvel can go from here. They've pretty much done the most epic Comic Book Superhero movie storyline they could have ever done, so what's next?7.5/10"
910,"May 1, 2019",10,"It wasn't what we expected it to be. The whole thing, the effects, the whole plot, the way the writer and the director put everything they had into this film was what kept 90% of the audience at the edge of their seat. We cried. We cried a lot. So many feelings. We felt overwhelmed and couldn't help but cry our eyes out. No matter who you are, where you live or what you like, please, don't spoil this film. #dontspoiltheendgame"
911,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"THIS IS A NON SPOILER REVIEW Avengers Endgame picks up where Infinity War has ended. It's full of story, full of heart and full of respect for the characters that we know and love profoundly. It's also beautiful to look at and has much better editing than most of Marvel. There are beautiful long shots and it's a spectacular view. If you love Marvel, if you have seen all (and in this case I recommend seeing all MCU movies before this one - trust me, it will help you understand many parts) then you are probably going to love this. And the marketing did do it justice - it really feels like an end of an era."
912,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"The end of the 11 year of journey is here and what a movie it is we cried, laugh,joy the every movement foen the movie we can't express the movie in the words. Such a beautiful work by russo brothers and mcu and what a great end is given to all cherecters."
913,"Apr 25, 2019",6,The worst avengers with weird plotchanges that took no risks. With a predictable story and predictable ending. Boring at times.
914,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I'm not really a fanboy but I couldn't resist watching all the movies. And it is true: -the three hours feel like less -emotion is insane (I had tears in my eyes too) -acting is impressive -action is awesome -finale is epic and movingGo watch this best marvel and superhero film and enjoy the top of 22 films!
915,"Apr 30, 2019",1,"Not worth it..... three hours from my life ..... Boring, long, it should be better."
916,"May 27, 2019",10,So Avengers Endgame was the most epic Marvel movie I've ever seen it's a celebration of all the movies in the MCU leading up to Avengers Endgame and it was a walk down memory lane the entire movie and it's filled with references only people who have been around since the beginning will understand and get and yes it's 3 hours but every second of this movie is worth your time I've seen it now 3 times and still wanna see it AGAIN! I don't want to spoil anything but basically it's awesome!
917,"Apr 28, 2019",10,All bias aside this movie is incredible and will change your life if you let it. 100% every question is answered and you will feel emotions that will shake you to the core. Incredibly well done and was truly a spiritual experience I mean that
918,"Oct 9, 2019",10,"Good performances, good dialogue driven scenes, nicely written emotional scenes, stunning visuals and an incredible third act. Such a wonderful culmination to 11 years of film making."
919,"Apr 25, 2019",10,Before this my all time favourite movie was Gladiator. But this one topped that . I have seen all Marvel movies more than one time. And the conclusion to all those movies is perfect. Ppl who don't like the story or the pace of the movie do not get what they tried to achieve over 22 movies. I can't see anything wrong with the movie. Things that bothered some ppl didn't bother me at all. This was the end of an era do ppl rlly want that fitted in a 2 hour movie NOoooo! Dont be a baby over the 3 hour sit. It is so worth it! If u can't see that than don't bother writing a review. I can accept bad reviews if they are thought trough. Everybody has their own taste but don't hate just to hate. I wrote this cause ppl that like movies don't leave reviews as often as ppl who don't like it. So go watch this movie and enjoy every second of it ;-)
920,"Apr 26, 2019",7,Was it good? Of course it was.... Was it the best one in the series? Not even close... I was so excited for this movie and I left disappointed.
921,"May 4, 2019",10,"I dont know how to say butThe movie just perfect, from the story,visual,acting,and the battle are just perfect, this is movie in generation, must watch quckly."
922,"May 9, 2019",1,"Plot holes everywhere, cheesy lines,basically the average superhero movie and no one sees how bad it is because they're blinded by hype, endgame was a mediocre poorly thought out rushed movie that feels more like a cashgrab"
923,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"A cinematic masterpiece ,an allrounder.a movie which will be remembered for a very long time."
924,"Feb 21, 2024",8,"In a big marvel fan. This movie is something that i have enjoyed from first to last. So thrilling exciting every bit worth it. The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. This film's world-renowned final battle is riveting, heartbreaking, awe-inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in a film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of its kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood-pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear."
925,"May 3, 2019",10,"The best film ever in this world, i hope marvel can make many great film im the future"
926,"May 1, 2019",10,I loved it 3000.Amazing movie. Recommendation is to watch in big screen.
927,"Apr 25, 2019",6,"There are just far too many inconsistencies and questions with this film to mention here. Suffice it to say that there is something seriously wrong when a minor character such as Nebula gets something like 60 minutes of screen time and characters such as Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, Spiderman, Black Panther, Winter Soldier and others appear for maybe 5 minutes..."
928,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Wow. Wow. Wow. From beginning to end, I couldn't think of a better ending to one of the greatest sagas of our lifetime! The writing was perfect and well paced. You had your expected comedy from a Marvel Studios film, but man when it took a turn, you were in for the ride of your life. I laughed, I gasped, and yes, I cried...a few times. Real tears. So emotional. I'm not sure any range of films could have or ever will culminate in anything close to this. Kudos to the actors who we took this ride with over the last 10+ years and of course to the Russos."
929,"Apr 29, 2019",6,"When the plot and storyline is weak, movie makers rrsort to great publicity. This is precisely what Endgame is all about. No fizz just gas."
930,"Apr 29, 2019",1,This movie was an hour and a half too long! The first half of the movie was slow and uninteresting. It did improve as it went along but was unnecessarily long and carried on with so much non sense that was not essential to the plot. Another example of an over hyped film doing well at the box office because of a big budget and star power. It is marginally better than the last Avengers movie but still mediocrity at its best.
931,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Please watch..... best film I have watched in my life
932,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"This was not the Grand Final i expected. It is just a Fan pleaser movie for the last Decade of MCU Films. I wanted to give it a seven, however I do understand why it was done this way, so it gets an eight. It was too much on feelings, to much slapstick ..anyway Homecoming is near to end phase 3 technically and I think it will be the better film overall."
933,"Feb 16, 2020",10,"To be fair there has been a lot of build up story and character development movies to this, but what a payoff. Will there ever be such reward for the audience that has followed the journey? I find it hard to believe. If there ever is I hope to experience it in my lifetime.With Infinity War to complement this main story-line, the audience is given an absolute treat. I am grateful to have followed this journey since 2008 and avoided all spoilers. Put simply, in my opinion, if you have seen all the preceding MCU movies, Infinity War and Endgame are the best action/superhero movies ever."
934,"Apr 25, 2019",6,Very long and boring ..... frankly disappointed me ... I left with the thought of seeing action as in the first part ... but almost he was sleeping ...
935,"Apr 27, 2019",10,You are putting yourself at a disadvantage if you never see this movie. The perfect ending to the perfect franchise.
936,"Aug 19, 2019",3,Way to long of a movie probably could of cut an hour out of it and it wouldn't have made a difference. Probably one of the worst Avenger movies I've seen. Very slow to get to the point and it do not hold my interest or my husband's.
937,"Jul 7, 2020",8,"This film is a great finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it wraps up all of their prior threads. There are references to years and years of films but it all feels like it comes together very naturally. The use of time travel was pretty well handled and didn't get as messy as in other films. The story itself and the twists were very engaging. One of my main concerns is Captain Marvel, who is so powerful that the writers have to contrive excuses for her to be elsewhere. Otherwise she could just solve most of the problems at once."
938,"May 6, 2019",10,Great film! Loved it! Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely fantastic! Brilliant actor!
939,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Just amazing. The plot, the dialogs, every choise about the film was extremely correct. The only bad thing is captain marvel, she still sucks."
940,"Apr 27, 2019",9,"Perhaps there are to many people that hate this movie, and other that love, personally, I love it, its beautiful, a gift for us, the last minutes I've smiled and cried. Obviously it's a good movie, but something is wrong, I dont know what it's but something is odd, and it taste strange, but everything have to end, right?"
941,"May 5, 2019",10,"I don't even know how many times I said ""you are KIDDING ME!"" out loud, in the theater! It was a LOT of movie for the price of the tickets. So much closure, so many laughs, and also some tears. I don't think any movie will ever be as worth seeing ever again. Thank you, Marvel, for an incredible story. Just perfect."
942,"Mar 1, 2021",1,I rate it 1 star because I hate Marvel movies and this is sooo boring. Godzilla is way better. P.S. Do not watch Avengers: Endgame
943,"Feb 10, 2020",8,"This is not at all a perfect movie. It has way too many plot holes and unanswered questions. But you can't deny that something like this has never been done in history, like having a 22 movie franchise within a span of 11 years, all interconnected and hitting the right emotions. For the people complaining about character development, you had almost spent 10 years with these characters. This is not a standalone movie and should not be seen as one. It is not meant for critis or awards, It is meant for fans. Not just movie fans but mainly Comic book fans. People complaining about hulk and in this movie should know that there are more than one green raging hulk in the comics and you are not less worthy of anything and thor showed that you are not less worthy even if you are internally broken and don't need to have a body like The Rock to be a superhero. I don't believe that it's a theme park, but I respect your opinion if you do."
944,"Dec 8, 2023",10,"A superior acting performance, a legendary movie that will not be forgotten. Love this movie and soundtrack, avengers theme song, best casting. I watched the last two Avengers movies for the first time in a private hall and I was very impressed. Why do I need to write 600 words here? Can't it be 150? What is the need for long Articles? I don't want to give spoilers, the movie was amazing in every aspect, I recommend everyone to watch it, I watched it 3 times in the cinema. What more do I need to write? Aren't all these comments enough? And finally, the series will continue, stay tuned. I Love it."
945,"Feb 2, 2020",10,"Movie is perfect, perfect final to infinity saga, thanks marvel"
946,"May 4, 2019",10,"The movie is a masterpiece, even that the first and second act are very slow, the movie catches you and makes you wait for the third act to arrive, and my man when it arrives... you hit the palm of such incredible that it is. And it ends with mastery, giving an epic end to a great circle that began in 2008. I recommend this movie to all who are fans of superheroes. Congratulations MARVEL, you got it."
947,"Feb 20, 2020",9,This was an incredible ending to the Avengers saga. Plenty of story and action. An emotional roller coaster at times. The Avengers franchise has been the best superhero portrayal yet.
948,"Apr 29, 2019",6,"It wasn't bad, bu it's a simple action cliche, with humor, without drama or deep message. What special about infinity war, is the conflict. The villain is not all evil. He wants to create a better world for everyone to thrive. Infinity war ends with a dissonance, and many viewers, me included asked themselves - maybe he is right. Endgame starts with a simple answer - the world is a mess after Thanos actions. I think the world can thrive even with half of the population, but here right from the beginning the answer is simple. Endgame switched from the attempt to make the bad guy have deep character, into a clear message: ""Thanos is all bad"". Well this message continues through the entire movie, and I hate the fact they ruined the deep complex villain character, with a ""want to destroy all, including his comrades "" boring villain."
949,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Just unbelievable, you never know what is going to happen."
950,"Feb 10, 2020",6,I'm waiting and hoping that Endgame will be more impressive. Which Infinity War makes me enjoy movies more.
951,"Nov 30, 2020",1,Dreadful and far far far to politically correct.Ultra left hug fest
952,"Sep 1, 2019",10,"Endgame is an amazing culmination of 11 years of Marvel movies, leading to an epic battle. The acting, CGI, and plot are on point. It was also great to have references from previous movies, showing that all of the MCU is connected.I fully recommend, but do watch the previous movies to understand context, characters, and the story in general."
953,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Bravo. Bravo! Somehow, one of the most hyped movies of this time has exceeded my (and many others') expectation. This movie leaves a beautiful bowtie on top of the gift that was the MCU. Unlike many other superhero universes, the MCU primarily focuses on character development over the abilities or powers of the heroes. This movie is no different. The first time I watched this movie, I was on the edge of my seat, crying, laughing, cheering, and throwing my hands in the air. No other movie has ever brought about this level of emotional response in me. Somehow, I was crying even harder the second time I watched it even though I already knew what happens...."
954,"May 4, 2019",10,This movie is simply art. The whole movie let you on the edge of you seat and it doesn't feel like 3hours at all.
955,"Dec 5, 2021",8,"I'm sure there are sites dedicated to the time travel inconsistencies in this movie so I won't go into them. There were a lot. That end fight was just way too much, I was checking the time and ready for it to wrap up by then. My favorite heroes were under utilized.It was a good ending to the infinity series. I'm not sure what I was expecting. I was just ready for it to be over by then."
956,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"If you think you have figured it out all yet you haven't, amazing ending to the greatest saga, 3 hours have passed like it was an hour, the humor is there, the tears, the powerful visuals, won't say much, every person has to see it. Amazing amazing amazing"
957,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"Disney knew it was going to make a ton of money from this sequel and so it feels like everyone involved in its production, from directors, writers and actors etc. just didn't bother turning up - aside from collecting their pay cheque. Anyone with a reasonable amount of intelligence and maturity will know the movie undelivered massively. Perhaps trying to weave characters in and out of previous movies took their eye off the quality of the offering. For those who have rated it a 10, once their excitement from all the anticipation dwindles, reality will sobering. Shame all the previous quality, especially infinity, has this movie associated. I should've known something was amiss when cpt marvel turned out to ba a total waste of time. MCU Phase 4...? You can shove that up your....!"
958,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I just watched Endgames, three hours are over; Tired, completely dehydrated after crying so much. And we instinctively held each other in hand at some point along the way, with my side fields"
959,"May 16, 2019",6,"I have a strong sentimental attachment for the MCU. I watched the movies for 11 years, and this was almost like a breakup for me. Infinity War was one of my best movie experiences, i was beyond shocked, exited and emotional. And happy, beacause no movie of the mcu has accomplished that in me, and was because the bad guy wins (happy endings got boring honestly), all those uncomfortable one-line jokes and witty remarks were few, all the encounters and character development were meaningful and wonderful set, and the battles, my god, the battles were so epic, so imginative and so so great. all of what this movies lacks. it´s 3hrs of pure emotion, with a bad written story and not particularly appealing visuals. It seems as if they went with the first draft of the scrpit. i can´t understand all the glory this movie gets. I feel very ripped off"
960,"May 1, 2019",3,"Ah, humanity.. if the collective decides that something is good, cool and great, it sees it through tragically twisted perspective. This time, everyone just seems to fall under the brainwashing hype train of this whole Marvel cinematic universe cultural farce. Let's just shut our brains off and ignore the absolutlely OVERWHELMING amount of stupidity and shallow, fake pathetics that these plots and heroes present us with.Not me! I'll say that the Infinity War was actually good, this was far too much of a brain hurting cringefest."
961,"Apr 29, 2019",10,The best film .... No more words.................................................................................................................
962,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This was the best adieu to last 11 years of marvel. It was emotional, i can still feel the gossebumps. It had its own flaws and I didn't get 1 or 2 answers i was looking in this movie but in the end I was satisfied, the second half went on another level and some set pieces will be remembered for years to come. Once in a decade a movie in this genre comes who defines the genre, the previous 10 years was The Dark Knight from this year onwards it would be Endgame."
963,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"God damn I laughed and I cried and I laughed and I cried, now I'm watching it for the second time, probably the third, I can't even remember how many times...."
964,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"It's absolutely ridiculous how this movie comes close to perfection. Considering the characters' story lines and how much this film does for fans of the franchise, it's truly a masterpiece."
965,"May 30, 2019",3,What a horrible way to end. A waste of 11 years. So sad.
966,"May 21, 2019",10,"End game is a culmination of over a decade of films and Marvel pulled it off better than any production company before them. The full cast were all second to none, the script was very well thought out and the action gave us all if not most, exactly why we had hoped for. There are sad moments, funny lines, dramatic build ups and the to trained eye, a closure to a lot of stories spanning from many fans would have even been born. Personally I've watched the film 6 times now and love it every time."
967,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a TV show finale. After 21 episodes that are all feature length. And before you can even say ""oh no those are all terrible"", this immediately proves itself to be an exception to that rule. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. Make sure you avoid spoilers before watching this.This picture moves fast and packs a lot into its not quite lean running time. In other words, it's directed by the Russo Brothers. The length is justified. I wouldn't cut anything from this. The emotional moments don't feel sappy. The countless callbacks and references don't feel like they're just there to make you feel good for paying attention to all that lead to this one. The acting shows just how well all of these performers understand the characters. And the screenplay does the same for the writers. The effects are astonishing, yet again getting us to care about individuals that we know are all CG. It uses the varied skills, equipment and the like, of the unique heroes and villains, creatively. This delivers deeply satisfying closure. It truly is a conclusion. It's not trying to get you back to the theatre for the next adventure. The few currently confirmed entries into this franchise don't need hyping, anyway. Spider-Man with Mysterio? Another Black Panther story? The unfairly fired James Gunn returning to round out the trilogy of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Solo Black widow, *finally*? More Dr Strange? Shang-Chi, The Eternals, Blade? Keep 'em coming.I recommend this to everyone who's taken this entire journey. And if you're someone who's skipped some, or held off on this series up to this point, this is an excellent reason to address that. Unless they're simply not to your liking. This is not going to change that. It's not meant to. 10/10"
968,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Well it's been a hell of a wait since Infinity War, but the Russo Brothers have delivered in spectacular style and quality.I loved this film in all its entirety and encourage everyone who goes see it to do a toilet check before the titles roll.It is an immense roller-coaster with many twists and turns.The studio keeps getting better and I hope it continues for years to come. Don't be dissuaded by the feature length of just over 3 hours, this is a MARVELlous spectacle for all to see!Make mine Marvel True Believers!! Full marks."
969,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"In a world where power means greed and the ability to destroy as opposed to protect and build. In a world where we tend to categorize and create tension as opposed to finding common good. Why shouldn't we believe in super heroes and the ability to overcome evil through seeking common good, unity and sacrifice. Script was excellent, performance was mind blowing ...Marvel Magic hit home! Everyone was clapping 👏🏼 Standing ovation as the credits rolled I can watch this over and over and over again!!!!! Mind blowing!!!!!!"
970,"Apr 29, 2019",10,It couldnt be better than this. I enjoyed every second of this cinematography icon.
971,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Honestly the best movie and cinematic experience ever. This is a perfect send off and anyone scoring it less than 10 is just trying to be controversial.
972,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"So i got the chance to see this movie earlier today in Warsaw,Poland. Now I know my title might be arguable to most people but for me and alot of the fans who have been invested in this for the last 10 years, this is no understating the fact that it is the best comicbook/superhero event ever! And possibly for a long long time we won't be seeing anything close to this.I won't say anything about the movie because i dont want to spoil the Endgame for you!This movie is everything and beyond what we could have expected it to be! it does more than that and it has that satisfying end we all wanted!I write this review today as a proud and emotional fan who is satisfied to see these 10-11 years being paid off!"
973,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"I want to give it 7/10 but +1 just for the potential of film makers who could present this conclusion.IW was just too perfect. Endgame must have been on the top of it, but sadly it is not.Despite of the difficulty to continue with the storyline after thanos' snap, this end is satisfactory.I think film makers should have taken one more part of Avengers to bring down the conclusion. This way they could bring more action to it."
974,"Apr 27, 2019",10,This was a very well written movie. I had my own theory on what I thought was going to happen but was proven wrong. It's definitely an emotional rollercoaster. Enjoy!
975,"Apr 27, 2019",10,The Best MCU film ever made. The 22nd movie of Marvel Cinemastic Universe have done loyality for all the anticipation of marvel fans. Every marvel fan will be heartbroken after seeing the movie. It is a must watch
976,"Aug 6, 2019",10,"I never have seen any movie in life that has such a great action and awesome fantasy , I am speechless and all I can say is bravo and will done."
977,"May 16, 2019",10,"If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, ""Excelsior!"""
978,"Apr 25, 2019",10,This is what all fans where asking for. It will hopefully beat avatar in box office
979,"Apr 24, 2019",10,This movie is perfect. its heartbreaking heartwarming and made with love
980,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Some of theories that you've seen online, happens, but not really. All I can say is they done a great job and there was the epic moment, which is my favorite scene. This movie will make you laugh, happy, amaze, and having a mental breakdown at the same time."
981,"Aug 23, 2019",10,This was the single greatest Marvel movie I've seen ever and it has everything that you could ever ask for in a finale.
982,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Never before has a movie made my jaw drop so many times before nor made me want to jump up and down in the theater like a kid on Christmas morning!
983,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Its kind of sad it end here. Its so graceful that the end game doing an amazing work as usual Avengers does . And It does even the best among all. Just a super experieances to be in the cinema watching this . The audios are actually cheers and clap all the times while the movie is playing . Its a wonderful moment of all time !! What a Great work for the Hero movies like this , like all !"
984,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"Absolutely littered with plot holes, this the last Jedi of this franchise. Don't let the nostalgic factor blind you from the poor writing."
985,"Apr 28, 2019",10,It was an amazing ending. Thank you for all the years and experiences that the Marvel Universe gave me. It was emotional to see that these guys may not be on screen together anymore but I belive that a new generation will come
986,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Helt utrolig fantastisk. Mye action, mye humor og litt trist."
987,"Apr 30, 2019",10,Best movie ever. Nonstop since the first second. I just watched it 2 hours ago and I'm still shaken and wired up about it. Definitely going to watch it again.
988,"Apr 24, 2019",10,What an incredible way to put a closure to this amazing story. I really couldn't ask for a better ending. Thank you for all of you who make this movie happens.
989,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"AVENGERS : ENDGAMEA Humongous tribute to the characters Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) for being a vital part in Marvel Cinematic Universe.Never seen such a huge franchise paying a proper payoff to these characters.Do not watch Endgame untill you watch all the marvel films starting from Ironman to Infinity war.First half of the movie travels at a slower pace because this flick contains a phenomenal story and character arc built for the powerpacked other half.Different dimensions of Capt'n and Thor characters were shown to the audience. Which will keep the them excited throughout the movie.Directors Russo brothers came up with an epic cinematic ending. The determination and conviction for such a complex screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen Mcfeely has to be appreciated.We as an audience would have presumed that this film would end in a certain way. But, there are lot other Easter eggs and jaw dropping scenes which excites us and also make us whimper.Overall, with Avengers : Endgame, there is really something that comes to an end. BTW keep your tissues handy!!"
990,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"The only problem with the movie is that it's too damn good. It'll take a long time to get over the awesomeness of endgame. Just sit back, relax and enjoy a masterpiece by Russo Bros :)"
991,"Apr 25, 2019",7,Great movie But not better then infinity war. Ending was the best part of it
992,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"If the Russo Brothers do not win an oscar for this film, that is blasphemy."
993,"Jan 12, 2021",3,"Was fortunate enough to watch this title in my late teens after becoming continuously disillusioned with hollywood blockbusters, especially comic book movies. Endgame is a glorious scrap monument of tropes and cliches with little continuity - it is Hollywood personified. While the MCU is an impressive achievement overall, a 2.5 hour long action figure line-up with sparkly, beautiful star actors interacting with glorified CG cartoons doesn't hold much substance beneath the glitz and glitter.If you're like me, however, and have grown tired of repetitive tropes, this is a hilarious unintentional comedy."
994,"Aug 24, 2019",10,"Wery wery good 10/10 mmmmmm, Nice! Oh my God! WOW!!!! Captain America and Third and Iron Man - good heroes!"
995,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"I absolutely love this movie! This film totally blew me away with such a remarkable story! To those not so true believers of marvel who thinks this film is not worth the money and say that it's not the greatest film ever. YOU SUCK! As a filmmaker I really appreciate what the Russo brothers did! Thank you Russo brothers for another great Marvel film! And god bless Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko for creating such remarkable characters that has touched my heart!"
996,"Aug 14, 2019",10,"I just watched this for the second time, (first was in the theater) and wow, i cant Believe that this was 3 hours, its sooo good, it goes by so fast! i loveed every part ! all the throw backs to previous MCU movies, this movie manages to be the funniest and most heart breaking movie within the MCU. i don't have much thats bad to say... i did not like stan lees cameo, captain marvel is so blah, and besides that, its perfect!i don't see any body who calls them self a Marvel fan could not enjoy this movie, that just blows my mind...."
997,"Aug 9, 2019",10,Words can't even describe how good this movie is I love it I could watch it thousands time and probably will
998,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"Just finished watching it in China, fantastic CG job, but I think the story should be better, maybe make it a two-ending will be better"
999,"Apr 24, 2019",10,This is one of the best action/superhero movies I have ever seen. It wraps the infinity saga up real good.
1000,"Apr 25, 2019",9,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) was funny, a bit sad, very entertaining, spectacular and maybe a bit too long for me personally. I did enjoy this movie from start till finish though, and while its not my personal favorite from them all, this was a very solid movie in my opinion (and i'm not a huge fan of these movies to start with, so tears haven't been found during my watch).Overall, ""Avengers: Endgame"" brings half of the Hollywood famous actors into one big, entertaining 3 hours (!) long escapism. At the end i enjoyed this film much more then i thought i will be."
1001,"Jul 30, 2019",4,"I think End game is non sense How could they destroy the story by missing with time ! killing Thanos erase infinity war so End game is never happen and I wonder about Captain Marvel ..half the univ disappear and she was to busy or did not notice tell she had a missed call ..and once more she come to do nothing here ! come on ! I waited too long for this movie to understand why the ""heroes "" of infinity war give up willingly infinity stone to thanos however the know what he will do! but now never mind it is just a movie no story not a big deal p.s I liked what happen to ironman"
1002,"Aug 21, 2019",8,That is the sign of a good movie. From start to finish your basically glued to it. And the humor in it is better than expected. The action and special effects are above avg. Good story line to follow the previous movie.
1003,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"Lucky to have watched it in the very first preview, not going to be spoiling things, but people you are witnessing a conclusion of 22 Movies, you can't be fair enough while Judging, unless you have seen the efforts of 10 years of Experience in making best stories to best movies, believe that or not, if you saw the rest movies and have an idea of what every character represents you will deeply appreciate that movie, and easily say it worth 15/10, so many sacrifices, so many happiness, joy and laughter, best cinema experience among all competitors, finally gotta say, MCU rocks all the way, after a low hit in Captain Marvel, they hit back in a way to blow your mind Planet Earth, enjoy the peace of art"
1004,"Aug 7, 2019",10,"Omg, marvel smashed it with his one, such a great ending even tho I cried and hated it in my heart (lol), buf after a bit of time and understanding the impact it had. It was for the best. Hope to see the greatest character come back some day or get his own movie."
1005,"Aug 7, 2019",10,What do I say this movie in incredible I started watching marvel movies around when the first avengers movie came out ever sense I seen everyone of them
1006,"Jul 19, 2021",10,"I've seen many reviewers on here bashing this movie for a lot of reasons. Logic Flaws, Dialogue, too long and drawn out, or simply that it lacks emotion because it's isn't non-fiction. These are the same people who would bash the movie for being too rushed or for the opposite of what I described above. They fail to understand that we don't go to movies to watch non-fiction, but to be entertained; and the duo of Infinity War and Endgame is as entertaining as it gets.Without giving any spoilers away, let me just say that when I saw this movie it was a completely full theater. The entire audience applauded 3 times and there was even one scene (you'll know it when you see it) where they all stood up to clap and cheer. Never in my years and years of moviegoing have I ever seen that happen and this is coming from someone who goes to movies every weekend. This is what happened so you be the judge as to whether all these one-star terrorists deserve the attention they get.Like the first part of the story, it has moments that will blow your mind, break your heart, make you laugh, and shatter your soul, occasionally in the same scene. Never in my life have I seen a fictional universe so carefully crafted to the point where I am made to care for every character and where emotions are raging throughout in so many different ways. Given that there are over 60 of these characters, that is very difficult to pull off and this movie did it.These two movies are an experience like no other and is one for the ages."
1007,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame (5 out of 5 stars).Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent awesome superhero film that concludes the infinity stones storyline that has been building up with 22 movies in the Marvel universe. They had done a great job building up each solo character and have there films bring something new and exciting. Endgame is the game changer that delivers the ultimate climax of the story arc with the big bad Thanos (Josh Brolin) going up against the Avengers. After the previous film Infinity War leaving the audience hanging with the cliffhanger. Marvel has done a great job in marketing and keeping this film spoilers free with the trailers that only show the same footage and very minimum. Which I will say it is best to see the film knowing very little about what is going to happen.I will try to keep this review spoiler free. Endgame is amazing and spectacular. Joe and Anthony Russo direction was fantastic and they did a great job in delivering a spectacular climax of the MCU. The plot was amazing. For a three hour long film. The film does move pretty fast and kind of feels short when watching it. I did feel like Endgame is a little short on the action set pieces like the previous films. Which this film does focus more on the emotional connections with the original Avengers like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and how they were all affected by the aftermath of Infinity War. The film does have a lot of fun and feels like a wild adventure with what these characters go through. The final hour delivers all out with an epic climax which every character has a moment to shine. And makes up for the lack of action in the movie. I love how every hero works with another when fighting there enemy. There were some moments where you will be in an awe and clapping moment with the climatic battle sequence. The visual effects are top notch great. There is some fun humor that will lighten the mood of the film. And there are some tear jerking moments that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. The directors did a wonderful job in surprising the audience with something new and reaching every characters full potential. The climatic fight scene with Thor, Cap America, and Iron Man teaming up and bouncing around with there super powers are just awesome. The surprises do keep on coming throughout. Which will leave you feeling satisfied.Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. The plot was amazing and fast moving. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited. The cast ensemble was great. I will say this is one fun wild ride that I am happy how it ties the story arc together."
1008,"Aug 10, 2019",9,"Forget people who say that this movie is crap,because the way I see it avengers endgame is the most entertaining movie in history so far."
1009,"Jun 29, 2019",3,Fell asleep during the first hour. Too much talking. Realized this movie was for the new generation. Nick Fury finally makes an appearance during the last five minutes of the movie. Three hours of my life I can never get back. Gag me with a Smurf!
1010,"Jul 31, 2019",10,"I just love this movie. Specially the climax, seriously one of the best climax I have ever seen."
1011,"Aug 20, 2019",10,"To all the haters, sit and think about the sheer amount of story, fan service, fun, epicness and sadness that they managed to pack into 3 hours. The Russo bros had to tie up 22 movies and that is impossible, yet they pretty much pulled it off, anyone who says the price of admission wasn't worth it just for the Captain America scenes alone may as well stop watching movies. This is a tough act to follow, and a far more worthy record holder than the blue alien pocahontas rip off ever was. Keep it up Marvel, we are eagerly waiting for the next 10 years of amazing stories."
1012,"Aug 20, 2019",10,"The film claimed to be super duper buster blockbuster hit after the movie Infinity War, and kept that promise also. Some Critics and Peoples said that the Movie is Overrated, but I can say clearly that they will definitely be DCEU fans who are saying like that for Endgame. They are just trying to undercast the grossing collection of worldwide. Anyway, The movie is for those people who saw MCU last 22 films and awaited for the conclusion as the twist was Thanos in their every movie. Feeling Sad for RDJ... 😭😭😭"
1013,"Apr 28, 2019",9,"Like every Marvel movies it has future'past experiences. Infinity war seemed more like a prequel. The perfect mixture of Avengers 1,2 and 3. And trailer says it all. ""Endgame"" as the name says it has a great ending. Thank you for the memories RDJ"
1014,"Feb 17, 2020",10,You can't do better then any of the avenger movies.
1015,"May 12, 2019",9,"The Russos couldn't have subverted our expectations in a better way. Simply, because they didn't give a hoot about our expectations. Instead, they gave us a a continuation of Infinity War with a most unexpected conflict. In other words, they went for the head; all we cared about are the stones.They also proved that they understand every character in this universe better than anyone. They delved into their minds and hearts in a way fans ever hoped and fancied. They truly fleshed out our beloved avengers by showing them as more humans exactly as we felt about them at every important moment in every movie in the MCU. They convinced us that these characters really experienced these moments, and thus cared about them as much as we do. The incredible cast, who are at the top of their game, couldn't have complemented what the Russos did for their characters more perfectly.Whilst the unique storytelling of Infinity War never feels ""cinematic"", I absolutely loved it with its epic quality and how I felt that I was flipping pages of a graphic novel instead of watching a movie. The Russos used once again the same exceptional style of narration here, except that, to my surprise, it feels as ""cinematic"" as it gets! I have absolutely no clue how they have managed to do such a thing, but what I know is that this made me realize that Infinity War is flawed, especially in this aspect, way more than I thought. Everything here works twice as good as it did in Infinity War: comedy and drama. Also, this made the fast pacing don't come at the expense of the cohesiveness of the story.The movie did make it a bit easy for itself sometimes (and we can see that in certain decisions that some character took, and a couple of things that are quite perfunctory that they could have gone deeper with), but the movie also took three thousand risks that entangled itself in what could have an endless loop of nonsensical chaos only to serve the franchise's fans, and it did as good as it gets.(9/10)"
1016,"Jun 21, 2019",10,"Wile it does have time plot holes, it is still a AMAZING MOVIE. It is amazingly sad. It deserves to be the highest grossing movie ever. And absolute need to see!!!"
1017,"Apr 29, 2019",5,"Most cringe worthy superhero movie I've seen. I was eye-rolling most of the time. Near the end I was just hoping for it to finally end. I mean, where to begin, is totally messy and nonsensical! All the time travel doesn't make sense at all. After all the hype I'm so mad at how bad it was."
1018,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Whether you like super heroes or not, you cant deny how incredibly well written and acted this movie is. Don't even worry about spoilers in this because there is so much happening. Remarkable job to Marvel Studios for putting together a movie that perfectly caps off so many movies they have released. You're missing out if you don't see this at some point."
1019,"Apr 28, 2019",10,I liked it alot. Fantastic performance and work from all the management and performers
1020,"May 5, 2019",10,"Excellent script, fantastic story, got to spend the right amount of time with the characters."
1021,"Oct 21, 2019",9,"One of the best avengers movies ever, with Thanos and all this is what all the movies have been leading to and the finale is great! The visuals are on another level. Some sad disappointing moments but that's how the story goes. You need to watch this absolutely if you are a Marvel or superhero fan!"
1022,"May 5, 2019",10,"No spoilers.This film is genuinely incredible, absolutely perfect end to the chapter. The movie ties up loose ends you don't even know are loose, it's just fantastic. Really couldn't rate this film any higher, an emotional range as broad as you'd expect from Marvel. . Laughter, tears, and elation all in a matter of minutes. Go watch it!"
1023,"Apr 27, 2019",9,"Endgame is too long. Why is that a problem? Because the length prevents the film from truly soaring to the heights achieved by Infinity War. I love the MCU and was as geeked out as anyone for Endgame, but I have to be honest. So here we go.....The movie is largely built around the original 6 Avengers and that's fine to set up the film, however, Endgame takes a VERY long time to get any real momentum. A VERY long time. It isn't until Ant Man arrives that any life is injected into the film. So here are a few let downs in my opinion...1. Captain Marvel is little more than a cardboard cutout and the personality she expressed in her movie is nowhere to be found. 2. You will be very disappointed if you enjoy seeing ""Hulk Smash!"" 3. You will be very disappointed if you hope to see much of Black Panther, Loki, Bucky, Nick Fury, Groot, or Gomorrah. 4. The film rarely lets loose the personalities we've all come to enjoy in Rocket, Star Lord, Happy, or even Captain Marvel for that matter.Now for some positives:1. There are some very good laughs that thankfully lift up the long run time. 2. Its a blast revisiting some moments from past MCU films. 3. It's nice to see the female empowerment themes and the potential set up for the Young Avengers 4. You can go to the restroom without missing something truly crucial. Seriously.Overall: Endgame is 30 minutes too long and this prevents the film from achieving a solid and consistent pace. It allows moments where we have to think about the ""science"" behind the action. The emotional highs and lows are simply not as impactful as Infinity War and some serious stuff happens in Endgame. The climax is enjoyable, however we have waited over 2 hours to see if our favorite characters from the extended MCU are going to appear and by this time the climax has to be compressed into a 45 minute ""epic"" battle that is barely on par with the battle of Infinity War.In short, Endgame is inferior to Infinity War. I should have felt deep sadness at times throughout the film and the movie was unable to create that feeling in me. I wanted to feel the same highs I felt with Infinity War, but those highs were few and fleeting.It wraps the Avengers MCU in a beautiful box, but when opened, I was underwhelmed. I got my money's worth in sheer length, but that running time was detrimental to my ability to deeply invest.Sean"
1024,"May 12, 2019",10,"Avengers endgame was in my opinion the best marvel movie to date. It was funny it was sad it had amazing action and amazing dialogue. I also liked how Thanos wasn't in it that much because he was the main character in infinity war. Thanos had 29 minutes, Ironman had 19 and captain America had about 14 in infinity war. I think this is marvel movies at there best I HIGHLY recommend seeing it if you haven't."
1025,"Apr 28, 2019",6,Avengers endgame had very little story progress through the 3 hr run it had and it created so many plot-holes along the way.Time travel is a very tricky story element to implement into your franchise it can make or break the franchise. They even touch base on some of the flaws within the movie yet still happen to create said flaws making the end product into a paradox of itself. I can delve deeper into that but I would risk spoiling the movie.Aside from the paradox they created they didn't utilize Captain Marvel like they should have. In fact she was used more like a one trick pony recreating her final moments in her own movie and recycling it over to the finale of this movie. She was more of a cameo if anything.They had some great moments but those were few and far between. In fact within those 3 hours I can only remember maybe 3 to 4 minutes of quality scenes (not including any trailer footage) which makes these 3 hours drag.So for the final Avengers movie with some of these characters it was a bit disappointing. Definitely not the best marvel superhero movie ever nor an epic conclusion like some claim. Honestly the Captain Marvel movie was more enjoyable and that's not really that great. 6.5/10 for me
1026,"May 4, 2019",1,Kids wrote plot for the movie. Ppl are getting made for nothing
1027,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I have Never dreamed of a better ending for this already incredible saga, than this one. Lives up to all the hype and anticipation and finally an ending which improves its predecessors in every way! GO SEE IT!"
1028,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Better than expected...it's just the best super hero movie ever made..and to me it is one of the best movies ever watched
1029,"Apr 27, 2019",9,"This isn't so much a movie as an experience. And the homework needed to fully appreciate this is daunting for the most dedicated fans. But the pay-off for sticking with the MCU for 11 years and 22 movies is nothing short of spectacular. So many shocking developments, awesome moments and tear jerking scenes that even the most critical, cynical moviegoers will just be beaten into thoroughly enjoying this movie. There will never be another cinematic moment like this."
1030,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"I had to think on my rating and review quite carefully for this film, as the final part of the movie elevates it from the rest of it.If I had to summarize this movie in one word it would be ""convoluted"". They take a sci-fi trope that always causes problems due to logic issues and went full steam ahead with it. The first two hours of the movie were quite unexpected, and by that I mean underwhelming, for the final movie in a decade long storyline.The movie comes into its own and gives the fanbase geekgasms about 20 minutes to the end, but it wasn't enough in my opinion. I have rated it a 7 as I truly enjoyed the way it concluded.There were a couple of scenes that made me laugh, but if as I wrote earlier, the final 20 - 30 minutes of Endgame are better than the previous 2 and a half hours of it, as there are too many flaws in logic and even the directors and screenwriters are not on the same page in their interviews as to how things are supposed to work.I won't bother with a suggestion of should you go see it or not, but unless you are truly blinded by love for the franchise, don't expect a masterpiece or the best film from Marvel so far."
1031,"Apr 28, 2019",10,What a film from start to finish. As per usual Marvel have gone and done it again.. Best film by a mile
1032,"May 4, 2019",6,I would agree with critics saying its a bit too hyped and overrated movie.Doesnt live upto my expectations. Sorry
1033,"Apr 28, 2019",3,So so over hyped a bit above average but far too long. The hype here is real thank goodness I only paid $5. Wait for it come our on Firestick.
1034,"May 28, 2019",10,"When my brother and I watched the film, it blew our minds away. Great fight scenes and of course the humor. I want to watch it again and experience the moment. Josh Brolin was excellent playing Thanos. This is the top #1 film in the box office and in cinema history. I hope this film will win an academy award for the 2020 Oscars. Loved it and enjoyed it! MARVEL RULES!!! EXCELSIOR!!!"
1035,"May 27, 2019",9,"This was a great movie and a proper end to the series.Besides some convoluted continuity issues, it was very well done.And the best part of all, minimal screen time for the newest and most widely hated Avenger of the bunch, CM."
1036,"May 5, 2019",10,We have witness something that we will never ever forget from marvels....
1037,"May 1, 2019",6,"I was ecstatic-- So ecstatic to see this film. But after just watching it. Honestly I don't know what to feel...The first 2+ hours was a snail's pace. I felt there were too much unnecessary dialogues. And being true to heart of watching all the Marvel movies, this one made me yawn at least 3 times.The ""good stuff"" only came towards the last hour. But even then the action sequences wasn't THAT great in comparison to Infinity War. It was a brief good entertainment to say the least...I believed the writers were trying to make it more of a sentimental kind of superhero movie instead. Which, don't get me wrong, it's a nice approach. As there were some touching moments and it can definitely bring out the tears (mostly likely affecting the sensitive folk) ... I just felt it was a tad bit much (emotion > action). Maybe a nice balance of emotion and action would do be more suiting, as I've always felt this ""balance"" in the previous Avenger movies.All-in-all, it was still a good movie. Not that great as typically people would expect (from the overhype and all). The ending was a real nice touch to the franchise. Now THAT brought on the water-works. Salute to that!So thank you--- thank you to all those who've worked on Endgame. I believed you tried your very best and though it didn't satisfied me fully. It still left others happy, overall. So people, do give it a watch. As there's still some worth in it. *Salutes*"
1038,"Jan 20, 2024",10,"Wow.Just wow.Be glad that this movie is 3 hours, because I wish it was 4. After Avengers: Infinity War, I thought it couldn't get any better. Endgame did so, and then some. Featuring the greatest ensemble cast to date, Endgame gives every character their storyline until they meet up in the greatest battle in the history of television. The first hour-ish was extremely emotional and saddening, the next hour is thrilling/stressful, and the last hour not only features the fight I mentioned above, but also a 3-on-1 vs Thanos that felt like your favorite sports team was in overtime in the national championships. Everyone who wants to see Avengers: Endgame probably has, but if somehow you haven't, do yourself a favor and watch it ASAP."
1039,"May 8, 2019",6,"I've never been a super fan of Superhero movies. Having said that have seen most of the marvel films. The one takeaway from Avengers Endgame is that it is an extremely ambitious piece of film making. It's unusual that so many of the actors and artists who many people have come to idolize over the years should come together in a film.The film starts five years after Infinity Wars ended. Not going to include any spoilers, but there's a good part of the opening half of the film spent looking into the devastating consequences of Infinity Wars which are very script/character driven. Not surprisingly the second half of the film is very much action based and the 3 hours running time fairly fizzes along. Although it isn't perfect Endgame is definitely one of the best Superhero movies I've watched and lived up to expectations."
1040,"Aug 10, 2019",4,"Very boring.. Not gonna see again, Will however see the first two installments, as they are way better."
1041,"May 28, 2019",10,Its sad to see it come to an end. But im satisfied by how it ended and how the story went through. With the usual expected sense of humor in marvels movies and a good story line.
1042,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Super anna tq so much This is the best movie in Marvel
1043,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"The best ever superhero movies.. Don't listen the haters ""DC Fans"" Please go watch yourself that MASTERPIECE, BEAUTIFUL, EPICMOVIE"
1044,"Jun 23, 2019",10,This movie was so unbelievably great along with the amazing cast. It DEFINITELY DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!
1045,"May 3, 2019",6,"Avengers : End Game was way too long. They could have wrapped up this story in 1hr 30min instead of stretching it out to 3hr. If you are less than a rabid fan I would recommend that you see this film at home. The crowd in my theater was attentive but strangely quiet and I didn't get much of a sense of excitement from the audience. Black Widow and Hawkeye had the best stories in this film and Ironman second. Ant man showed up and was fun and Rocket (the trash panda) represented the Guardians of the Galaxy (I'm a big Rocket fan 😊). I did not care for the Thor bit. I was disappointed with how they handled Thor's character - it just wasn't funny. The other Marvel characters showed up but the directors could have just set up cardboard cutouts and had voiceovers for all they contributed to the story line. It does not work as a stand-alone film - you have to have seen the previous films to understand it. I made my poor sister go to the movie with me (she had not seen all the previous films) and she felt tortured and bored (her words). She said that I now owe her ""big time"" Sheesh..."
1046,"May 9, 2019",1,"Please don't waste your time with this one. This movie was the worst, most cringeworthy waste of a good story I have ever seen."
1047,"May 1, 2019",10,I have to say that is was the best Marvel movie so far. It left me speachless on couple ocasions. I went through all types of emotions in just 3 hours. Russo brothers did an amazing job keeping us on the dark side with the trailers. I LOVE IT!!!
1048,"May 12, 2019",10,Well worth the year long wait best film from the mcu
1049,"Feb 12, 2020",10,This is the greatest superhero movie I've seen in years
1050,"Oct 16, 2020",8,"Let me get this straight, this movie is totally overhyped and I don't recommend wasting the 2 hours of your precious life just for an enjoyable last 40 minutes of the final battle. Even the final battle wasn't up to the mark, after an unimaginablely awesome portal scene we get 10 minutes of entire 10 years of MCU just punching, that's it which suddenly ends by sacrifice of iron man, and marvel even wasted a character like Spiderman. And did the death of black widow had any influence, I don't think so, an awesome character who ended up as a glamor in the movies. Overall this movie is a no go, if you want to watch it, go for the last 40 minutes, the rest is crap."
1051,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"This is the best superhero movie ever. A perfect culminations on those twenty and something movies: it's masterfully knitted into Marvel Cinematic Universe. People in cinema were laughing, crying and applauding. It's a great blend of drama and action. There are so many scenes that are unique and beautiful. ...And the ending is memorable... This is a perfect ending of one MCU epoch and it's hard to believe they will ever be able to top this. And for that I feel sad."
1052,"Jun 23, 2019",10,I have watched this movie three times already and I'm still GUSHING about it! To put it simply: I loved this movie 3000!!
1053,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Im not the usual type of people that review movie after watched it.But i cant hold it for this one. The visuals are great, the sounds are perfectly fit, the story, the battle, the character. Basically almost everything are perfect for this one!!Great job Marvel, thank you. I really enjoy the endgame."
1054,"Jul 29, 2019",1,Wost movie ever seen total waste of time no action no nothing just bad bad bad bad

If there ever was a film that defines the term ""epic,"" Avengers: Endgame is it."
1057,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"It treated the audience as savvy enough to not have to over-explain problems related to their heroes endgame strategy; as a shorthand they just referred to a few movies enshrined in popular cultureThe climactic action scenes ticked all the boxes for a good fight: The Shine, the Cut-off, the Hope, the Double-down, and the Finish. There were literal cheers from the audience I was in during The HopeCallbacks to previous movies: Proof that Tony Stark has a heart, Kill Mode Activated, the Elevator scene (and its surprising resolution)Iconic shots uplifted from the comics (the ""farmer's"" scarecrow)Completed character arcs stay completedIf you're out of the limelight for 5 years kids won't know who you are and won't want a selfie with you"
1058,"Nov 2, 2019",10,How is it even possible that someone that watch marvel movies watches this film and does not like it? Honestly I think that some of these reviews are from competitors. The movie is really a masterpiece. 3 hours of a great work. 10/10 is the least I can give!
1059,"Sep 16, 2019",10,The best movies till now. common how many worlds I have to write?
1060,"Apr 29, 2019",6,"There is spectacle, although like a lot of massive CGI battles, you can't figure out what the hell is going on (Frankly, Hawkeye's sword fight with another human might have been the most coherent fight). There are SOME tender moments that work (and others that don't). There were lots of funny moments, usually provided by Thor.All in all, a capable action flick. But, it could have been so much more, if they'd gone full nerd. Why do I say that? Because nerds would have got ""power"" situation right. The heroes powers fluctuate so greatly between movies, and even within the movie that it could drive a purist mad. There is nothing wrong with fantasy movies (e.g. sci-fi, space, Hobbit, etc.), but the worlds need to be internally consistent to be fun. Also, the ""cavalry charge"" at the end of all these movies is getting tiresome. (But, I get the ""nick of time"" stuff generically pumps up the ""dramatic tension.""...a little)Anyway, it isn't top 10 of the MCU, but it's probably top 15. I'd still probably see Deadpool over and over again, rather than continue to see these middling, mass produced, corporate exercises. Like Star Wars the early years with Lucas instead of Disney. These corporate movies will never endanger the golden goose, or do anything surprising."
1061,"Sep 4, 2019",10,Makes me cry everytime i see it. Loved every second. I don't understand these other reviews saying they are dissapointed. To me it was perfect
1062,"May 26, 2019",3,"This movie was a huge disappointment after the last one. Way too long, no character development, and a foregone conclusion. I'd say skip it but if you're an avengers fan, you have to see the ending. In that case, wait for video and don't expect much and you'll be fine."
1063,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"The conclusion that we have been waiting for, super awesome!"
1064,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"""Yeah I guess you are right : This movie is a total mess with complete insignificant plot. I don't know what happened in the Russo's head while making the scenario. They must have hung their ideas with something like : We must satisfy our fans and give'em everything they've ever dream to see in a super-hero movie. Such an idiot way to think huuh? Seriously this movie sucks, with no emotion, no value. Everyone who liked this movie are complete idiots and should calm down. By the way the CGI is terrible and the acting is weird.""-From the biggest random, heartless, no emotion, idiot, unbelievably reckless, completely unattractive, purely uninspiring, poor, ugly, rude, very unpleasant, inhuman, horrible persons in the world."
1065,"Apr 24, 2019",10,The best Marvel movie so far! Perfection at its best!
1066,"May 24, 2019",8,Infinity was was better than end game. what you have done with thor is not good
1067,"May 1, 2019",6,What a huge disappointment. Hulk is a wimp. Thor is a fat drunk. No fight scenes. I am a huge Marvels fan I could not have been more disappointed with this movie. Anyone saying this was great needs to be evaluated.
1068,"Apr 28, 2019",10,The fact that some people disliked this movie honestly baffles me. This movie beyond exceeded my expectations. It was a perfect mix of humor within sadness. Throughout the movie I would constantly get goosebumps from the sheer epicness of the moment. Truly a perfect ending to an era. I applaud the directors.
1069,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"Pretty sure Robert Downey Jr. Got his lines wrong. What he clearly meant to say is that Back to the Future is a much better depiction of time travel. Long gone are the days when movies had real emotional empathy and believability; they must have been washed away on the shores of time. Great Scott, if only we could go back to when films had tangible sets and characters with substance and weight.This movie begins where Infinity War left off, with half the population doing a disappearing act, involuntarily, of course. Our main protagonist, Iron Man, is lost in space and somehow found out of nowhere with very little explanation. The new kid on the block has a talent for picking people out of space-with her bare arms, or so it would appear. Eat your heart out, Superman!Yet we're willing to let most of this go, as the task of expanding the universe further seems exhausting enough. With a barrel load of characters to tackle, not even three hours can save this mess. Perhaps because they stick to the Hollywood Marvel formula, we get the routine thirty-minute battle scene that feels like watching a kid play Mortal Kombat. The only thing missing is the vintage ""Finish Him!"" voice at the finale. The battle scene even brings to mind the chaotic climax in Ready Player One. Once again obviously the visuals are stunning yet it's all way too predictable.Don't misinterpret me-I don't mind a well-built-up epic conclusion, but unfortunately, this felt like a reversal of what had already materialized in the previous outing. In terms of character and acting, our main bunch handled themselves to the usual standard. We get nice chemistry, wisecracks, and charisma throughout the film, though the pacing is a little slow at the start. There's a good thirty to forty-five minutes of ""getting the band back together."" Far from the charisma and charm of The Blues Brothers.Without giving too much away, it's a very linear, one-dimensional story, but it still packs a bit of a punch with some humor and emotion sprinkled throughout. In terms of empathy, I felt more for the characters toward the end than at the beginning. They seemed to move on from their losses too quickly-except for Scarlett Johansson's character, who was the only one that made me feel like it had really happened. The chemistry between Johansson's Black Widow and Jeremy Renner Clint Barton/Hawkeye makes for compelling story telling. However, the previous film had lot more depth to its story in comparison. Often repeating aspects of what has already transpired in previous Marvel movies all on the verge of building to an epic battle. (Robert Downey Jr) Tony Stark adds some value with a heart felt moment back in time with his father during the Cap days of world war.Overall though, it was an average finish-nothing to go too mad."
1070,"Mar 30, 2021",2,This film was so poor I left feeling the whole MCU was less because of its existence. I now think twice before putting on any MCU film knowing that this is the Endgame.
1071,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I keep my expectations low for this movie. And it's turn out AMAZING!!!Once is never enough, I Will watch it again and again. I'm not ready for this movie. Prepare yourself guys.."
1072,"Jun 15, 2020",9,"And so it arrives, the culmination of nearly 11 years, 3 phases, and 21 movies, (or almost 41 hours of storytelling), Avengers: Endgame is finally upon us. And for fans that have invested their time (and money) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe over the past decade or more it is hard to see how you could be less than blown away by the epic 3 hour finale delivered by the Russo Brothers.The fan-service paid in film 22 of an incredible cinematic arc is off the charts. Which sadly means if you are coming in to Endgame with a limited knowledge of all that has gone before then your experience of this latest MCU entry will be a much poorer one for it.That is not to say if you are brand new to this universe you wont enjoy Endgame. There is LOTS to enjoy even if you don't know your Stormbreaker from your Mjölnir. But it is worth investing some time to get to know the background to this closing chapter.If you have lived through the Battle of New York, galaxy saving dance-offs, the rise of the Dark Elves, the fall of SHIELD, adventures in the quantum realm, and lack of Starbucks in Wakanda, then you are surely in for a roller coaster ride full of many emotional highs and some deeply crushing lows.It is almost impossible for me to talk about my personal favourite moments from the film without dropping spoilers. And this is an event that you really don't want spoiled for you going in. The goosebumps, the adrenaline surges, the punches to the gut in some of the rawest MCU moments to date; no one deserves to take those feelings away from you. Aside from the beauty and majesty of many of the scenes, (not least the climatic showdown), this movie has an energy that injects directly in to the veins. With that in mind I will talk about those specific heart pounding, tear duct swelling beats another time.While the Russo Brothers will invariably receive all the plaudits for Infinity War and Endgame, the contribution of writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely should not be overlooked. They have crafted an incredible story over these last two instalments encapsulating everything that has gone before with near precision. While the expectation in the action stakes was always high, and boy oh boy the action does not disappoint at all, there was always the risk that sentiment would be laid on in heavy doses. Thankfully that is not the case which is a testament to the wonderful writing of Markus and McFeely. It is a script that intertwines the complexities of the story while hitting the right notes in the right spots, especially the comedy and lighter moments which are plentiful.Endgame is not without its faults, few and minor as they are. Pacing is occasionally a little off, entirely due to some over cooked exposition of major plot points. But in the grand scheme of things these are nothing more than quibbles and entirely forgivable.While Endgame may not be the greatest, most flawless movie ever made, it is certainly up there with the best of all the Marvel movies to date. Perhaps even among the best of the superhero genre.There is one scene I do have to mention that annoyed me a little. Some are already referring to it as the ""girl power"" moment. While it was incredible to see all of the female MCU protagonists on screen at the same time, the moment for me felt incredibly forced! It was almost like someone at the last minute said, ""Hey, you know what will be really cool?"", and they shoehorned in this ""moment"". For me it deserved better than the after thought it felt like it was and will stand out for, perhaps, all the wrong reasons.In summary, Endgame is the near-perfect summer popcorn blockbuster event. And if you have been as invested in the MCU journey as I have from day one it will feel so much more than that. This is a genuine love letter from Marvel to the millions that have given so much of their time and passion to these movies and the eclectic stories and characters that have developed and entertained us over the past decade. From the opening moments it crescendos its way through your soul leaving you elated, exhilarated, and positively enthralled. And in the final minutes, with the gentlest of kisses and tenderest of goodbyes, you will be left with crushing sadness yet a feeling of contentment and satisfaction ... a very real closure to everything.And if you are new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or just have a passing interest, do yourself a huge favour. Watch Infinity Wars, at a minimum, and then get along to see Endgame. Just make it happen ... whatever it takes."
1073,"Apr 30, 2019",10,Everything I have been waiting for for the past 10 years and then some! Everything paid off in the final act of the movie. The greatest hour in superhero movies that will probably never happen on the big screen ever!
1074,"Jul 21, 2019",10,Awsome. Im stunned. How in gods name can someone give this movie a rating of 1?
1075,"Apr 29, 2019",10,A movie worth watching. If you have a busy schedule them too give 3 hours for this movie.
1076,"Jun 23, 2019",10,"An epic finish of The Infinity Saga. Great movie, great story, emotional movie etc. Congratulations to all Cast & Crew you guys did a great job and specially to Robet Downey Jr. Mr Kevin Fiege and The Russo Brothers you guys are the best!"
1077,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"He's right. Basically everything he wrote above. The movie was entertaining and well worth the time, but it doesn't deserve a rating higher than decent.And oh.. don't pay for it. Free stream it. NEVER support the greedy milking ****s at Disney corp."
1078,"May 12, 2019",10,"Great battle, effect, story and characters THE BEST MOVIE I EVER HAD"
1079,"Apr 28, 2019",10,For me this was the perfect ending to a long journey in the MCU. I have ready a few reviews and I get some of the reactions. But the emotional roller coaster was just what I needed. It was hard to say good bye to certain characters but Plenty of doors were left open as we move into phase 4. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did. I won't post much more than this so I don't ruin the movie for anyone.
1080,"Aug 20, 2019",10,"Just wow. I have watched every Marvel movie from the very beginning, and after I literally bawled through the end of Infinity War, I couldn't wait to see how this amazing saga would end in Endgame. And it certainly didn't disappoint. I absolutely LOVED the movie. It had many hilarious moments, great CGI, and some really heartbreaking and heartwarming moments which literally brought me to tears. A true credit to the creators of this film and the actors too. If you haven't yet seen it, ENJOY."
1081,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Better than infinity war. Ending is very emotional, and is very shocking. Wow, just Wow."
1082,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"The movie most disappointed. Boring but exciting in other moments. I've expecting receive an epic and amazing ending after 22 movies. But. I just received and screenplay with black hole that eat the logic and congruence. I'm disappointed. Furious.I want to see a marvelous movie. But, why? Why marvel? You made a movie full of no logic just completely made for fan service. Is just a mixture of back to the future, and other moves referenced in.Was good. Not epic. Was bad. Not terrible.Unfunny. The jokes don't made me laugh. But see all superheroes in screen was emotional and right. Some minutes were boring and useless. Some characters were wasted."
1083,"Apr 29, 2019",10,Avengers:Endgame is a superhero film we all yearned for after the Infinity war spectacle and The Dark Knights standard but this film surely was far beyond expectations and was gripping entertaining humorous and emotional. Yes the movie kicks off to a slow start about the Avengers still learning and moving on from their loss but they found a way to reverse the ruins. Thanos the mad titan and the villain again proved to be one of the best villains abd surely some competition for the Avengers. It is a movie which will stun you This movie is a Perfect 10/10
1084,"Apr 25, 2019",10,It could have been better made movie as a special ending to 12 years of MCU series. Poorly scripted storyline with wasted screen time on unwanted characters.
1085,"Sep 19, 2021",10,"This is how you make a finale, damn. It's very good and emotional, and managa to perfectly conclude 11 years worth of buildup. No other movie can achieve what endgame has."
1086,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"3 Hours full of emotion, action, tears and laugh.This is how you end the filmBeautiful, impactful, amazing"
1087,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"My Rating : 9/10This is exactly why people go to sit in a dark room with bright lights bouncing back into their retinas for pleasure!Now on to the movie - 'Avengers : Endgame' is a finale of sorts of the Marvel Avengers Franchise which started back in 2008 with Jon Favreau's brilliant 'Iron Man' and we are already 21 movies in after 11 glorious action-packed years!'Avengers : Endgame' is emotional, super funny and lots of little throwbacks to the previous movies for nostalgia value will make this the most talked-about and entertaining movie of the year - There's no place for critics here, it's about the fans' love for the series given justice. If you go looking for plotholes or keep thinking 'well this doesn't make any sense' or 'wow that's dumb' - this isn't for you! All of the MCU movies are romanticist in nature and they are for all ages to enjoy so they can't exactly become too dark or complicated for that matter.Thumbs Up to the Avengers for making it a happy fan experience (and a bit teary-eyed one)!"
1088,"Apr 27, 2019",6,"End game was so melodramatic and slow! can't believe it needed 3 hours! I was expecting something ala infinity war, but no, this is no way near that movie..."
1089,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"After watching Avengers Endgame , I am ready to say, with all my heart, that this movie is the most unique, fun, touching and satisfying movie ever... Oh and it's not only the best superhero movie ever, it's the best movie in history 🙌 --- ASSEMBLE!"
1090,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"I'm a bit disappointed on the melodramatic first act. It was a really, really poorly written melodramatic first act.It was, with Black Panther and Hulk, the most boring passage of a Marvel MCU movie. Some great parts here and there (mostly Tony, which was basically god like perfect in this movie, including Downey's perfect acting) and Rocket.When the actual movie starts (and stops being basically an epilogue, a bad one, to Infinity War), it gets interesting even if a bit confusing (even with three hours, the plot explanation goes fast).And in the end, the movie lands the epic ending. No words necessary.Also, I would never watch that first hour and a half again. Which is a shame, considering how perfect Infinity War was.-------Oh I forgot (this is an edit). Captain Marvel was in this movie (barely). I absolutely ADORE HER in every aspect. Her attitude. Her character. The actress. The looks.But oh boy, her power level! Don't know if it's good or bad yet"
1091,"May 4, 2019",3,"The length of the movie increased with long talks, which makes almost no contribution to the plot or highlight heroes characters. Instead of Marvel usual excitement feeling (although I am not big fan of comics) you get the feeling was it worth to spend 3h. If the movie would be brutally cut to 1.5 it would be good end product by Marvel."
1092,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Should had a 3000 stars rating. Awesome movie the best one I've watched.
1093,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Ok, I have invested time and energy diligently watching (and enjoying) each one of the 21 Marvel Movies that lead to the culmination of the Infinity Stones Saga, over the last 10 years.This movie really is the best cinematic experience that I have ever had. It hit every note, never disappointed and when the credits were rolling, I was already planning when to watch it next (in the cinemas), who to bring, etc.To all the folk involved in the making of it... Wow! Truly world class ✊😃😎🙏🏼"
1094,"Oct 10, 2021",10,"After a historically shocking setup, this beautifully imperfect movie really stuck the landing. It's an accomplishment many franchises just couldn't do (ie Game of Thrones, Star Wars sequel trilogy) but Marvel pulled it off, which just has to be recognized as special. Our OG Avengers end their stories here in a film that balanced fun, humor, and sheer emotion very well. I've never experienced such feelings or had such fun in a movie theater. It truly felt like I was living through history. My favorite Marvel film."
1095,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"You think ""Infinity War"" was mind-blowing? So was I...but man...""Endgame"" is simply the best cinematic experience in my life and every fan since the beginning of the MCU can confirm it! I still got chills after this movie...it will haunt me for so long! You'll cheer, you'll laugh, you'll scream and also you'll cry...a lot.Watching this building of characters since 2008 on big screen and watching the culmination of it is hearthbreaking and emotional!Also...they kept the script very well. 3 hours long movie and I needed more at the end!Thank you Kevin Feige, Russo Brothers and all the cast members and people behind the scenses, who made this thing real. This is life event!I can't wait to watch it again and again and again with my friends...and yeah I'll cry just like the first time, but man...worthed!"
1096,"Aug 20, 2019",10,"This movie wrapped years of marvel movies I have seen and it was epic, people are saying it was slow it was boring, I don't think they understand how the movie was the story had emotion with that emotion you lived the last ever marvel avengers movie.This movie is just amazing it has thrown everything in the mix and I would say if you have not seen this movie your are missing out."
1097,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"If you thought Avengers Infinity War was the best Marvel had to offer, think again. Marvel ups their game by several notches in this movie. It's the perfect movie for the ending of a saga of Marvel movies. It's three hours of pure joy excitement and enthusiasm"
1098,"Apr 29, 2019",3,"Badly made. First hour felt like thrown together in few minutes. Some jokes just went out too far, I was really hoping them to go away towards the end... But no. Many characters simply ruined forever, which makes no sense. I did not enjoy the movie Most of the people will say this is good because of the Fan hype. I'm a Marvel fan all the way, but this just wasn't it."
1099,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"I think the storyline is great, really enjoyed it and it's really quite unpredictable. The scenes were really heart-warming but I had one serious issue with the character development and power scaling. That didn't allow me to enjoy the movie fully and when it ended I didn't get the very satisfied feeling which I had from Infinity wars."
1100,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"And they made the one that really, really worked. There were old people, 70+ years old, and young,6, 7, or 8 years old. Total fans and people who had only seen a few of the preceding 22 movies They all applauded. There were times the theatre was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. There were times when everyone held their breath. There were times you could not be so stone coldhearted that you would not tear up. There were times when you could not help but smile. There were times when you had to laugh. There were times when you recalled a special moment from an earlier movie in a brand new way. There were things that are brand-new By the end of the movie you saw the whole series in a different light. I wish I could see it again without ever having seen it beforehand. There were so many small touches that made the movie special and capped the series perfectly. And yet, the movie worked for people who had never read the comics or seen most of the movies. Like I said, they made the one that really, really worked. Thank you, Avengers! #Cap #Tony #Thor #Nat #Clint #Hulk"
1101,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"A great end of an era. That's all I need to say. Not a crazy Marvel fan, but this one just got me right away."
1102,"May 20, 2019",10,I've always been a fan of comics either DC or marvel i was fan of both and supported both sides but to be honest The MCU is way better than the DCEU dont get me wrong but DC got a good future as i saw in aquaman and shazam but to see how all these 22 movies of the MCU just connect and reach its peak is just pure gold a great ending to a great era and i just can't wait what the phase 4 is going to bring us
1103,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Man this gotta be the best one, it wasn't how i thought it was gonna be but it was still dope......."
1104,"May 1, 2019",6,Had huge expectations from End Game after the ending of Infinity War and it just fell flat after initial 40 min's.Movie feels boring at lot of places and the ending....lets not talk about it... could have been more sensational. There are few moments having humour...but those moments are very shortlived. What worst...made martyr of character whose movies were the best of all Marvel Universe.
1105,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"An epic film in size and enjoyment. Everyone involved with this film deserves a standing ovation. Many films are hyped up to a hysterical point but then fail to deliver! However when it comes to EndGame, there will be little to criticise in this epic conclusion to a generation worth of mostly brilliant films!"
1106,"Apr 29, 2019",6,I was just expecting more action... I was relatively bored for the first 2/3 of the movie.
1107,"Sep 8, 2019",3,It's rewind time everybody! I hate this movie. Go away.
1108,"May 5, 2019",10,Very cool movie! very emotional and beautiful film!
1109,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"The more you think about this film after seeing it, the more perfect you realise this film is to end off the collection of Marvel films. You will laugh, cry and have a whirlwind of emotions but if you're invested in Marvel at all, you MUST see this film."
1110,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"The MCU movies have been not just about the storyline they portray. They were the last frontline of cinema in times of on demand tv shows, at least from my recent experiences at the movies in a rural area of Germany. People setting alarm clocks for ticket sales and sitting through double/triple features after midnight, this is when movie magic really happens for me and I fear that this is the culmination and the end of this kind of cinematic culture. Nothing like this has been done before and it is uncertain if we will ever see such an epic journey of interwoven films again like this.This is a thank you to anyone involved in the creation of these film, since I am grateful for this experience and always was looking forward to the next chapter in this story. I hope there will be more stories like this to be told on the big screen, but I fear nothing will ever compare to the excitement before watching endgame in the midnight screening. This is what great moviemaking looks like and my wife and I laughed, cheered and cried along the way. Thank you for this masterpiece!"
1111,"May 15, 2019",10,I went to see this with high hopes but wasnt sure however i went to see this and boy was i impressed the action was full and exciting and even the humor was funny i do suggest if your theater lets you get extra snacks as the movie is long in lenth so so good though also keep it away from small kids the violence is too extreme for their little minds
1112,"Apr 28, 2019",10,10 stars because it almost made me cry (when i say almost I really mean almost because I do not cry)
1113,"Apr 24, 2019",10,What a movie !!! With respect this is the best movie of super heroes ..that's my opinion
1114,"May 12, 2019",6,"Wow, that was a major anti climax. With a title as 'Endgame' you'd expect it to surpass every story before, not an endless get together, 1 major battle where 1 action here solves it all and then a lengthy farewell. Wished they would have spent more on a good script instead of on 1 big scene full of CGI"
1115,"May 5, 2019",3,"A 3 hours Marvel film with 2.5 hours of drama, 15 mins of actions and 15 mins of something else.. seriously?Their logic didn't make any sense.Besides, what they did to Thor was brutal."
1116,"May 5, 2019",10,Endgame gave several realistic endings to this amazing and ultra fantasizing world. The story lines were so in depth and crazy twisted and concluded in an unimaginable way.
1117,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Marvel has done it again. I won't spoil it but it has everything we've come to love about this franchise. I think only one or two things could change to improve it, but nothing major that's for future! It felt like family on the screen, and the theater filled with avid fans felt like family too. It was a crowning achievement, Stan would have been proud."
1118,"Jun 24, 2019",10,"I saw a many houndred of movies in my life. And there are a lot of them, they were really brilliant. But this year, Avengers Endgame filled up the whole year at the beginning.Great, Fantastic, Actors, Directors, Camera, Sound, SFX, Music. Alan Silvestri. One of the best scores since Forrest Gump.The Ending Scene is so full of love. I am really impressed. I was laughing, crying. So much of it. Thank you Marvel Studis, Thx Disney to feature this finale.People, I love you 3000"
1119,"Apr 28, 2019",9,Dont agree with what Marvel decided for Black Widow ..and no acknowledgement for her! Some Great scenes and twists! All around great! Boo on no post credit scenes!
1120,"May 4, 2019",6,Ranged from merely ok to messy and contrived. Disappointed they resorted to a time travel movie (was that the best they could come up with??). Hated what they did to Hulk and Thor. Hawkeye was irritating and Captain Marvel was hyped up for basically nothing... Infinity War was far far better.
1121,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"Best way to describe a three hour venture without recklessly diving into spoiler territory. The movie excels best at its central element of time travel, which is rather where the momentum is truly its natural best. The characters are all rounded, perhaps more so here than Infinity War. This is likely a fair take on what results now as a quadrilogy than a trilogy. When the action really gets to its peak level, it's almost effortless with the buildup doing every bit of the talking. The most curious turnout is the studio's first ever movie to be well over three hours, which to be frank could have succeeded with more than the overall result in this movie. Just a thought at hand, rest assured the pacing eventually comes to a fitting close that won't underwhelm the overall theme of what's termed the Infinity Saga. The emotion and depth really get to how things play out, also a bit improvised over Infinity War and in the viably greater ways. Got to lose a point for how it uses fan service done right as a sendoff to breeze through the buildup process up to the key parts that make this movie the ultimate conclusion it will be for a long time. My favorite of the Russo brothers' directed movies remains Civil War, simply because it was a Captain America movie of all the flicks back then that really pushed hard to reach a well deserved billion mark. This might get there a little too easily. Duh, but noteworthy. Give or take eleven years and twenty two movies, which as I mention is twice its bargain. Facing Thanos the second time really says something, which is likely all to consider about it."
1122,"May 2, 2019",6,"Good but nowhere near as good as people are saying, it's just the same as all the other superhero movies really nothing special."
1123,"Jul 29, 2019",3,Wow horrible weak Story..i feel like am watching epic movie and Meet the Spartans.......😒😒 don't waste your time watching this!
1124,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"There is no other way that an amazing journey like Avengers could've wrapped up. The fire started with Iron Man in 2008 with some marvelous people including the one and only Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreau and ended with the epic piece directed by the Russo Brothers. As Tony Stark quoted, :""part of the journey ended"" and left a legacy to being remembered by so many generations. The movie is definitely a masterpiece of this era which puts us on emotional rollercoaster, enjoy a flashback of the memory lane and a lot of kick-ass stunts. It tattooed our head and heart so deeply that we can never move on from this brilliant piece of jewel. One can only hope that marvel will lit the beacon again in the coming years to sustain this honorable legacy. My advice to all the people, Go watch it, even if you are not a fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe or ""superhero"" movies, you would find it once in a million worthy for spending your money and time both."
1125,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"I was watched this movie. But, i didn't move on. This movie was very-very amazing and epic."
1126,"Aug 16, 2022",10,"Avengers Endgame to me is the very best MCU film to date. Not only because of the decade of buildup we had to this chapter but also the incredible acting and action! Everyone is on their A-game here and they are committed to it fully.The action is also amazing! While it does take a while to get to it, when it does happen, it puts a smile on my face every time I see it.It also represents how far comic book films have come. While there were certainly good ones before, this one shows how well they can be done and that they are worth seeing on the biggest screen. It also serves as a fantastic celebration of these characters and tribute to the comic book world.Even someone like me who never really got into comic books growing up, these movies are greatly digestible for anyone who is unfamiliar with them and are always fun to watch.Overall, Avengers Endgame is my favorite MCU I've seen."
1127,"May 15, 2019",10,"You can't give rating to this movie just based on 3 hours spent in movie theatre. This movie is (like title says) end game. It's end of the 21 movies combined. Everything has been leading to this, and it ended in most spectacular way. Yes, you can watch this movie without seeing first 21, but you simply won't understand it, and therefore, you won't like it. But, if you have seen the end game, do not bother to watch firs 21 movies, because you already spoiled yourself ending. There is the reason this movie got so much hype, and that is because we connected with every character in it. It doesent matter if some characters didn't get much screen time in end game, because we had our time to watch them, get to know them and their stories. I won't talk about CGI and other stuff, thats personal preferences, but let me just say, amount of effort to get this resoult is aomething you won't bee seeing in short time. Best MOVIE FRANCHISE EVER for me, gets 10/10"
1128,"May 3, 2019",9,"Words aren't enough to describe the culmination of the Infinity Saga. It was just beautiful, from the amazing action set pieces to the well knit plot that tied up all the main character's story archs in a fulfilling way, all I can say is Marvel and the Russo Brothers really outdid themselves this time round. 11/10 for me."
1129,"Apr 29, 2019",6,The film with the number of heros it shows looks like a show? Each want to say I am here in the film ! Nothing new ? It seems media played a lot in creating a mass positive thinking ! Long for 3 hours. A lot of talk that can be removed without affecting the film story? Its a kids film.
1130,"Apr 30, 2019",6,"I would be lying if I said that I wasn't a little disappointed. The Avengers: Endgame has been one of the most anticipated movies since... well since The Force Awakens but that was way back in 2015 and in this day and age that's like a million years ago. The point being: Endgame was the talk of the town since all of those beloved MCU characters faded away. Infinity War was such an epic movie what could Marvel do as an encore? Or better still, what could Marvel do to conclude the magnificent journey they took us on?If anything, Endgame proves that it's hard to write a perfect ending. Perfect endings are stuff of legend. Whether the ending has a twist, a ride off into the sunset, or a mixed bag they are hard to write and hard to execute. Endgame is supposed to be just as the title suggests: the end. This is where the Avengers wrap it all up. Endgame was one long goodbye and it seems they tried to make it as heartfelt and dramatic as possible.Infinity War started with a bang and ended with a bang. It was a fast moving roller coaster throughout. It came together so nicely with all the different characters, the different tasks, and the different battles. It was a superb blend of flavors that came together for an excellent meal. Endgame, on the other hand, was almost like a decompression. If you were huffing and puffing from Infinity War then Endgame was a chance for you to rest, catch your breath, and absorb all of what happened. It was a long slow exhale with just one last burst of energy before retiring. And it wasn't what I was expecting.Not that getting what one expects is necessary to be considered good because sometimes you can be surprised in the best way. After all, we've trusted Marvel thus far so no reason not to trust them to put the finishing touches on their masterpiece. Now that I've seen their final brush strokes and the completed work I have to say that their hand slipped a little when adding the finishing touches.Like a fireworks show or a symphony I wanted the ending to be this huge crescendo. I'm not talking simply about the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, but the entire movie. I wanted to see all of the fine Marvel characters in their finest form, or close to it, as they went for their last hurrah. I wanted them all to be like John Elway retiring after his second Super Bowl, retiring on top, not Muhammad Ali who held on too long and had a less than flattering exit from boxing. But that's not what I got.We got to see heroics, of course it's a superhero film, but it was so subdued. The entire tone of the movie was muted. It was a somber morose three hours. The humor wasn't as humorous. The fighting was somehow less awesome. Everything was just darker and more lifeless. Even the hero moments which were supposed to evoke the most joy, awe, and righteous triumph didn't quite do it. Now it could be because it was 12 a.m. by the time the movie wrapped up and I was tired but I don't think that was it. Many a movie has revived me due to it's captivation. End Game didn't revive me or stir me in the way I thought it should. If anything, they put me to rest along with the Avengers saga. I was going for a conclusion, yes, but I also wanted reinvigoration and revival. Sadly, I got solemn and subdue"
1131,"Aug 3, 2019",2,So i just watched it for the second time yesterday and i have to be honest this movie is boring as hell until the final fight and now that I watched it for the second time the final fight was ok this movie is so overated in my eyes firat time i watched it i was nearly falling asleep in theater because nothing intersting was happenning people going to hate me for this but I dont care I had more fun watching Dark Phonenix then this boring ass movie mcu movies are so overated in my opinion!
1132,"Jul 22, 2019",10,Best movie ever and very good movie. My favorite movie ever when it come out on dvd I will buy it.
1133,"Apr 27, 2019",9,"I love the ending for each characters. And only hate Captain Mavel, she tried to act like a ""super man"" who does not care about anyone or anything, and with a mind of teenager, she willing to jump into the enemy without thinking. Great job! I wish the film does not have her."
1134,"May 6, 2019",10,I walked into the theater buying snacks for supposed to be the biggest hit of the spring well i must say i did not expect much however what i got was stupendous so so good loads of laughs action and adventure so much fun i do not recoomend taking the youngest of kids and also as this is a long movie if your theater lets you refill your snacks then you should do so
1135,"Apr 28, 2019",10,It was an amazing culmination for the first phases of the MCU.
1136,"Aug 4, 2019",2,"What a boring, predictable excuse for a movie. I'm so glad I resisted the hype and didn't suffer through this in the theaters. It's obvious this movies reviews are artificially inflated on this site, just look at all the other negative reviews."
1137,"Oct 14, 2019",10,This film was done so well. The 3rd act I will say in my lifetime will never happen again. This movie brings all the feelings inside to life 10 fold. I love this movie
1138,"May 28, 2020",10,"Avengers: Endgame will be a film that I will never forget. When I first saw it I loved it. It serves a satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga with how it wraps up what was started in Infinity War while giving wonderful send offs to some of the most recognizable characters that we've grown to love ever since 2008. Overall, this movie was fantastic and personally is and will be a film that is not forgotten due to it being such a satisfying conclusion to the already great Infinity Saga"
1139,"May 17, 2019",9,This movie was all and more. It was a long movie but I never got bored. Thought things were gonna go one way and it went totally different. I will say the very end let you know what movies where coming back and hat characters wouldn't be returning. It also lets you wonder if maybe things are how they looked. I want to go see it again
1140,"Dec 6, 2021",9,"Many of the wars in the Avengers series were fought in New York. However, the actual shooting took place in Atlanta far more than New York. The headquarters in Avengers - End Game was also discovered by audiences. It was the US headquarters of Sany Heavy Industries near Atlanta.In addition to being the shooting location for this movie, Atlanta as the ""New Southern Capital"" , it is the headquarters of many multinational companies such as Coca-Cola. Furthermore, there are also Olympic Memorial Park and Stone Mountain Park for outdoor activities.Atlanta has four distinct climates. In winter, it is warm. In contrast, it is hot and humid in summer."
1141,"May 2, 2019",10,I watched the movie twice so that I can give a proper review and get clarity on my thoughts . The first time watching the movie was a rollercoaster ride but the second time around I could appreciate it much more ... Yes there are many flaws in the movie without a doubt but it gives an amazing closure to most of our beloved characters. Joy and sadness ....
1142,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"While infinity war left us loads of questions, endgame stay true to its name. We will remember fondly this finale as years go by because of the emotions we invested and reaped."
1143,"Apr 26, 2019",7,"I just went to see the Avengers Endgame on Apr 25th, in Hawaii.First, I have to say......it was a good solid movie. However, it did not touch me or speak to me. I was not moved at all. The Infinity Wars, was far more emotional and gut wrenching, this one was just an attempt to change things up, do the unexpected, and try desperately to wrench our emotions.I will simply say that in this movie I was never mad, hurt, sad, or excited. No emotions this time.Some of the battles were epic, and some were hyped up and fizzled out quickly, and some battles just never happened. Some disappointing moments.Finally, when the battle was reaching a climax, and the home team got a chance to exact some revenge, things felt petty and predictable. Honestly, might have been better to follow the comic arc and stay true. Honestly, for the life of me, I do not know why I was not choked up in certain scenes when I should have been. Seems they were trying to hard to touch our hearts, and it felt disconnected.Three hours later......and had to wake my wife up several times which is usually a sign. She was wide awake in Infinity Wars, beginning to end.So if you just looking for revenge or a reckoning, congratulations.....you got it. But if you are looking for real emotional struggles and happy reunions......mehhhhhh......they tried....some were decent.I will not give any spoilers, but I will say I am flat out angry because my favorite character of all time, since I was a child, did not fight! Seriously, WTF?! And after what happened in Infinity Wars, it makes no sense."
1144,"May 5, 2019",8,"Avengers: Endgame is a film directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. This film was my most anticipated one for this year for a number of reasons. The trailers got me pumped up and increased my anticipation even more. But after walking out of that cinema hall, I felt that the creators did justice to all that was served to us in these past 10 years.Plot: The Avengers decide to reverse Thanos' action done during the events of Infitnity War.Story and direction: As this will be a non-spoiler I shall try to be as generic as possible as tio what I liked and didn't like about this movie. This film is a conclusion to a long story arc that started in the beginning of this cinematic universe. Yes, the film is three hours long (by far the longest in the MCU, too) but the best thing about the film was that the film never felt that long. And, for that, I would like to give a big salute to the creative minds behind this mega-blockbuster. In each and every minute of the move, you do feel for the characters. There is a sense of human-ism which is quite rare in superhero movies, which I was a big fan of. None of the scenes felt misplaced or unnecessary. I even liked the risks that were taken with characters which too is very rare for a commercial movie. The MCU brand of humour is there in some moments and I just loved them. This film had a proper balance of tension, entertainment and laugher, which is what wants from any kind of movie. Talking about the action scenes. OMG!!! They were huge, awesome and fantastic. Also, the VFX. My God!!! I can imagine the VFX artists had to do to bring so many of these scenes to like. And I salute them in doing that in the most seamless and effortless way. Alan Silvestri has also done a wonderful job on the score. I don't remember tearing up in any movie, but I surely did in this one. This film had such a profound effect in me. But in saying that, there were some scenes that did feel like plot-holes. Also, with the announcement of so many movies and TV show spin-offs this film still didn't manage to address so many things. But these, things are any way secondary to me.Performances: Now if I list each and every cast member and their performances, this review will go on and on. But still, I will do some highlighting. People have been wanting Robert Downey Jr to be nominated Best Actor for the Oscars next year. And I really hope they do because this was the best of Tony Stark in the MCU. Chris Evans as usual is fantastic and I saw a side of him in this film which wasn't even tapped on in this universe. Chris Hemsworth was the funny man in this film. His scenes just made me laugh. Same can also be said for Paul Rudd. Mark Ruffalo too was just great as the Hulk and Bruce Banner. Scarlet Johannson and Jeremy Renner made me remember what made them so special and unique in this team. Josh Brolin again was fantastic as Thanos. All the rest of the cast members too were just great and commendable.Favorite Scene: This is where I am out of words. But I will say it anyway without giving away anything. I will say it will be the one during the final hour of the movie where you will feel that are heroes have nothing to do. But then there comes a ray of hope and you feel that victory will surely touch our heroes' feet. Verdict: Is this film perfect? No, absolutely not. Does this film satisfy the MCU fan? Hell yes, it absolutely does. This film just made me realise why I love movies and why my love increases every day. Its exactly for films like these that I live for. Do watch the film in 3D (IMAX, if possible) for the best experience and I am sure you will have a smile on that face yours feeling a sense of completion and happiness. If the MCU has more films up in its kitty, bring them on because I seriously would like to see what more can they give. Yup, and for the first time ever: NO POST CREDITS. So don't need to wait till the end waiting for some random scene to show up.I am going with an 8.5/10."
1145,"Jul 2, 2020",9,This is where everything we've watched comes together and it is a thrilling movie experience. Although still not as good as the original avengers film. It is truly impressive how everything is blended beautifully with a mind flowing finale. Sure the time traveling stuff feels a little unnecessary but it works for the overall story. Its complexity gives all the performers here some inspired moments. I mean it was one hell of an experience being in the theater opening night and watching the audience go insane. This too me feels like the end of these films and although it goes on just a bit too long it ties everything up nicely.Budget: $356m Box Office: $2.797B9/10
1146,"May 1, 2019",10,"Framed in emotions, a farewell to all core charecters. The film strikes through every expectation in terms of storyline, action, visuals and humor. It will give you Goosebumps, it will make you laugh and will emotionally satisfy at the same time. Don't follow these negative reviews...JUST GO AND ENJOY. Its a grand conclusion to 21 epic movies of MCU and things have been placed in the right direction to make it memorable. #Don'tSpoilEndgame"
1147,"Jan 20, 2022",9,"Entertainment. It seemed to me that there were fewer special effects, but the quality did not suffer from this, it looks in one breath. Marvel has definitely become a trendsetter in special effects. I will especially note how either make-up artists or computer scientists worked on Thor. In general, Chris Hemsworth, as it seems to me, will be remembered by many as TOR. Five.The acting. On high. It is impossible to single out anyone in particular, everyone did an excellent job with their roles. Five.Originality. In my opinion, only the quality of the film can be called unoriginal, as it continues to maintain a very high quality of the saga. Otherwise, the development of the film is completely unpredictable. For me, for example, there were several plot twists that were completely unexpected. But the most unexpected thing for me was the absence of two videos after the credits. Definitely five.Music and sound. If there was something wrong with this film with the soundtrack, it would surprise me very much. And so, in terms of sound accompaniment, everything is tip-top, there is nothing to be surprised at. Five."
1148,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"Infinity war was way better, in my opinion. There was a lot of plot holes in the movie to begin with. They had many cringe bathos moments and they crammed in too much emotional elements just to make the movie a n uplifting finale."
1149,"Apr 27, 2019",10,It was like Christmas coming early. The movie great and I highly recommend it. I'm not gonna write a dissertation just know the movie was good.
1150,"Apr 25, 2019",6,You can see how the story goes in first 10 mins Takes forever to finish
1151,"May 4, 2019",9,"It's not like infinity wars, but not less engaging :)"
1152,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Emotional. The perfect goodbye. A movie for the fans, to the fans."
1153,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"No spoilers here , I won't write anything , I just wanted to share that this movie is one of the best movies of a lifetime that you can watch now. Go watch it !!!"
1154,"May 5, 2020",8,A great ending to the phase 3 of MCU. The film's climatic battle is way better then any of the battle in infinity war and more emotionally charged than its predecessor. The background score was tremendous with equally good cinematography. People who rate low emphasis more on plot holes and goes way more technical than required. A film's job is to provide entertainment to its audience which it does satisfies.
1155,"May 4, 2019",8,"The movie is great. They try to present itself as the ultimatum epic movie and i believe it succeeded. There is an epic moment on every corner.The overall plot is a lot of mess, too much fan service and the action is good but could have been much better. A lot of mess in the battle scenes too.The movie is pure entertaining and fun. Don't bother too much about quality and technical stuff."
1156,"May 27, 2020",10,"Most excellent movie-verse ending with excellent war sequence at the climax. The war scenes are excellently directed and visualised. And also how the time travel has been handled is very good though not comparing with others. Everyone has their own time travel theories, we shouldn't judge. It is a movie which ends an era of MCU-phase-2."
1157,"May 11, 2019",7,"The comic book hero genre is what I call ""bulk viewing"". A mass produced product that has a formula that's repeated over and over, with a few tweaks here and there, to keep the viewer coming back for more.Avengers: Endgame is yet another case in question. I knew it going in and was in no way surprised by a predictable end to a mostly predictable story.Its not bad as such. In fact, if you can accept it for what it is, its quite watchable on a superficial level. I'll add I'm not a film snob I enjoy a simple action romp from time to time and this certainly comes recommended.There's a lot of wall to wall action that's well paced and keeps kicking along. My only gripe is the overcooked ending, that's so syrupy and sentimental, you could spread it on toast.7/10 from me."
1158,"May 7, 2019",3,"When the focus is on a few characters, this film shines but the overall focus is blurry-literally and metaphorically. I'm not kidding. Imagine one of your favorite Marvel characters having an awesome fight with some adversaries and the gigantic IMAX image on screen is cropped so that you see only the hero's head, shoulders, belt buckle and arms only up to the wrists because the baddie he or she is fighting is completely out of the frame. When you see the credits and see the leagues and leagues of artists who worked on this thing that were sacrificed on the pyre where they burned the steadicam or the glidecam and an editor that needs to cut from one place to another every two seconds and needed a strong sedative, you will long for a Spielberg, a Ridley Scott, a John Ford or a Hitchcock who knew how to frame things and didn't let the camera and editors run wild."
1159,"May 6, 2019",8,"This is a worthy follow up, one of the most action packed, emotional, and well made movie in such a long time! Every actor is at their BEST! And when a scene hits hard, it REALLY hits hard. Great Effects are also showcased throughout this film. Their is a reason that this movie is blowing up, because fortune favors the bold! Bohemian Rhapsody"
1160,"May 11, 2019",10,"Ok so it's 3 hours long, believe me the time flies. This film is engaging, thrilling, emotional and breathtaking. Not over the top but serious fun."
1161,"May 20, 2019",10,Totally amazed by this movie. Best movie of the Era!!!
1162,"Apr 28, 2019",8,"I would say Endgame is in the top 5 of all the MCU. It's cgi was brilliant and at times the story was beautiful. There are three things that I feel endgame didn't do well. Thor. Although ragnarok worked with the action comedy, I feel they went to far in endgame. It feels like they where almost mocking the character and at every turn you had no choice but to laugh at him. Thanos. How can thanos without the stones be so strong? I understood in Infinity wars his power but even with the stones he got crippled but storm breaker but suddenly in Endgame he's even stronger with Thor seemingly unable to use storm breaker in the same way. I feel the whole time travel although great to look back at 10+ years that brought us to endgame, there was no structure, it all felt messy. I love the MCU and I still rate the film. For me as this is my opinion, had they got these things right it would have been the best MCU film ever. Like I said had some beautiful moments within the story and that helps pull you through the movie."
1163,"May 29, 2019",6,"A poor finish to the avengers saga. Too many characters with not enough to do. The final battle was underwhelming. Some of the main characters (Thor,hulk) reduced to buffoonery. Some good points like cap and Starks final ending. Thanos is probably one of the best baddies ever. The guardian's and antman were poor. Far too long a film and was padded in places although I can forgive it because we probably wo t be seeing the actors continuing in their roles. Not as disappointing as game of thrones though. Younger viewers will love it."
1164,"Apr 30, 2019",7,Pretty good but I wished for more. More movies with just one super hero
1165,"Aug 5, 2019",4,So bad they shoukd of thought about this for lonher
1166,"Nov 12, 2021",9,Sir please add IMAX VERSION of this movie. ALL the movie is so great that every time i watch it gives me more details. And today is the day when i watch it again so add it as soon as possible.
1167,"May 2, 2019",10,"It gave us everything we needed. Heart, humor, action, closure, and a perfect ending. A series can only go on for so long and it was beautiful. Infinity War set the bar high and I'm sure we all expected tremendous satisfaction, although the dialogue was more excessive in Endgame- there was a lot to be explained. I think this was the best result and it's naive to expect more character development, fight scenes, or explanations... there was a 3 hour period and it was executed to the best of its ability. A huge triumph for the avenger saga and I loved every minute of it."
1168,"Dec 9, 2021",10,"You guys are about to release an extend version of this extremely watched, iconic and expected film with only 7 minutes more? Realy? That saga deserve at least 30 minutes of extra content. I liked the conclusion because i am watching since the very beginning (that's a bunch of years) and i want more than just seven minutes, actually, every fan deserves more cause we are the ones who kept this whole adventure going. I Hope someone that can make a diference (like an avenger) read this and understand."
1169,"Jun 21, 2019",8,It was great but I expect more for the finale. I hope re-release version make it happen
1170,"May 15, 2019",6,"Endgame and Infinity War are pretty much on the same level in terms of entertainment. And that level is not very high. Look, there's no magic. The first Avengers movie had it along with many of the other firsts in the group. But that magic has gone away. First off, please don't hit us over the head with the emotion hammer. You did this by trying to lengthen out shots where characters look into the distance... for 10 seconds OR look at each other and hug 5 times. What was 3hrs could have been easily 2.5hrs with a little slice of that here or there. Overall, you're seeing the film for the characters you love... you're almost forced to if you're a comic book fan. If you're not a fan - don't bother."
1171,"May 4, 2019",10,"In all honesty there is no recollection of any Marvel movie that can and did deliver on the full rollercoaster of emotions. I mean yes there is the strongest of possibilities you will cry in an Avengers movie.Endgame I'm sure you don't have to be told is set after Infinity War, infact five years after, we see how the surviving gang have been impacted by the loss of their friends from the actions of Thanos. From there they take us on a journey of how they can fix their wrong. You wont even recognise that three hours have passed as it keeps you fully engaged.Without giving too much away you will see how the next adventures may transpire and why there is a Guardians 3 coming. Really if you're a fan of the franchise you're going to see this anyway, so....... There will be no spoilers here (#dontspoilendgame)."
1172,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"After almost 48 hours of story Endgame is the epic fitting end the MCU deserved for the Infinity Saga. As someone who was never a fan of comics growing up, and only saw the first Iron Man movie as part of a work function, I have come to await every installment eagerly and this one most of all. It didn't disappoint and the non stop story made 3 hours feel like 1.5."
1173,"May 6, 2019",10,Avengers endgame is beyond a great movie...! It is a cinematic spectacle which for anyone watching is a breathtaking experience 22 films in the making a likely experience which defines an era.
1174,"Apr 26, 2019",10,What to say Awesome❤ Powerful fight❤ But I think little logic mistake.. Whatever. Movies is very nice❤
1175,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"What can I say, Epic, emotional, shocks and twists.... No one is prepared for this. The movie felt like 1.5 hours even though was 3 and could have gone for another hour and still flown by. You will need to watch multiple times as a lot happens that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and to process everything that goes on. The ending credits are different to pay homage to the cast and to signal end of an arc spanning 11 years. This movie deserves to knock avatar off the highest grossing movie of all time. From Aus to U.S you are in for a wild ride once opens.."
1176,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"This is for the MCU fans, a truly heartfelt, emotional 3 hour journey into characters we have grown to love over the last 11 years. It's not perfect, they took huge risks, some I didn't like, others I loved! A Few things to know: It's light on action (until the last hour) In favour of telling a slower story and letting the characters simmer in a scene. Take tissues Don't take a toilet break There are no after credit scenes. Overall I loved this movie. It's a fantastic and satisfying conclusion. 9/10 Where I rank this in the 4 Avengers movies - 1st Where I rank this in the MCU - 2nd"
1177,"Feb 13, 2020",6,"This movie really is what you would call a cinematic event, seeing as it is the culmination of 10 years of storytelling across several movies ( of varying quality). But Endgame doesn't feel as satisfying as Infinity War or as entertaining as Ultron.Seeing this in the theater with a cheering crowd was unlike anything I've experienced as people were crazy hype about this one, but outside of the appeal of crossover between characters the film isn't too entertaining.The three hour runtime is very much felt (especially on rewatch at home) and there are a lot of scenes that just feel like exposition.A decent Marvel film all things considered."
1178,"Jun 1, 2020",10,BEST ACTION BEST DIRECTION AND SUPERB ACTING BY ALL ACTORS 🔥🔥❤❤❤👌👌⚡⚡👍👍
1179,"Jun 7, 2019",6,"Just because Marvel made the movie Hollywood's highest-grossing doesn't mean that this is one of the best Movies in the history, also this is not one of the best movies of the Superheroes genre, not even the best Marvel movie which is Iron Man since this is the only one decent they have in their lousy repertoire called the MCU.Sorry fanboys but is the true."
1180,"May 4, 2019",10,Greatest superhero movie ever and a emotional dose first time in superhero movie amazing adventures and love u 3000
1181,"Jan 6, 2020",8,"Best MCU movie. Pew Pew!I thought the Russo Brothers wrapped up everything very nicely blah blah blah... what else do I have to say... you've already seen this movie. It's the highest grossing film ever made, everyone and their grandmother's have seen this movie. Go see independent films, i guess. Woopity doo!"
1182,"May 4, 2019",10,"This movie is amazing. It's emotional, it's funny, it's intense. It's everything you want from a movie ending a decade old story arc. The movie is beautiful, the story is engaging, the acting is on point. The humor is exactly when needed and never too much. The fight scene... that was something else. The ending feels like a true ending and it's a treat to watch. This is the comic book movie to beat and I loved every second of it. 10/10"
1183,"Jul 29, 2019",10,I gave this movie a 1/10... watch IMDB change it to a 10 Pay to play. Welcome to the real world.
1184,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"For me Avengers Infinity War was perfect marvel movie. this one was ok, not great not fantastic, it's just ok. it would be great if they didnt force too much comedie into the movie where half of population went missing and it was normal that we have a kind of drama/action movie and not another comdie action (when you see thor and hulk you will know what I'm talking about). it's ok ending. captain marvel arrival feels like GoT night king lifting dead dragon with chains in the middle of nowhere and nothing.I hope there will be some another edition, where they cut it all stupid, not funny scenes and present real dramatic through whole movie, and not only last half of hour"
1185,"May 1, 2019",8,"I appreciated the movie greatly. They handled time travel in a very deft fashion, and tied it up nicely. I appreciate that they managed to maintain stakes for future installments.I have been a marvel fan since MY beginning. I read the comics as a kid, and made my own costumes. I latched onto the MCU from film 1 and have been there for every up and down of the franchise. I am proud of how they brought this era to a close."
1186,"May 31, 2020",10,"LOVE LOVE LOVED this film. Great characters and storyline. Had you laughing and crying, shouting at the screen and grabbing for cushions. Glued from start to finish, and will most definitely be watching again and again."
1187,"Nov 23, 2020",6,While not a total disaster it's way below what i'd pay to watch. i'd rank it at 5 wich is right under what i consider worth the time to watch
1188,"Jun 3, 2019",4,"Everyone built this movie up, telling me it was amazing. They made it sound like it was the best one ever made...but I was completely disappointed.It's was long and stretched out, they had to put things in there that didn't have any business being in there, and in the end I just felt like it was a big ball of confusion.I was very disappointed in this one and so was my husband. Infinity Wars was great LOVED it but this one wasn't great."
1189,"May 3, 2019",10,"I just loved the movie. It has everything happiness, sadness, comedy , tragedy . Loved the subtle references to the past and how everything was balanced , how every character got the perfect closure"
1190,"May 28, 2019",9,Many times movies leave unanswered questions. This movie does an exceptional job of answering all of the open questions from the previous movies.
1191,"May 13, 2020",10,"Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family."
1192,"May 6, 2019",10,"A story that Russo brothers started 10 years back came to an end.The fictional characters made sure they remain with us till last breath. Goodbye hurts no matter how beautiful it is and ofcourse not watching AVENGERS ASSEMBLE in future will even hurt more.Thats how impactful it was, even if you haven't watched any marvel movie watch them watch them all and witness the magic of how a 180+ minute movie binds you with emotions,actions and of course never ending love towards our superheros. Kudos............."
1193,"May 1, 2019",10,"This was more than what I thought it was going to be! Without giving anything away (Thanos demands your silence!), it was perfect. I laughed, I may have had some ocular leakage, I laughed more. The acting was great, it was hard to watch some of my favorite characters to seem defeated, and depressed. The ending was the best. I have seen it twice already and will probably see it a third time."
1194,"Apr 28, 2019",10,One of the most awaited movie is finally here and it lives uoto the expectations and does not disappoint at all
1195,"Jun 2, 2019",7,High hopes for this one but a bit of a let down Im sorry to say.
1196,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Beautiful, exciting, unexpected, emotional, sad and funny... I felt emotionally depleted 💔 after the movie but if I could I would have seen it immediately a second time! And it didn't feel like 3 hours, time flew by..."
1197,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Gonna be honest. This has to be one of the best movies of all time. One thing I liked is that you have to have seen the other movies before this. Just to make sure you have your facts right. It brings you back to the first Iron Man. It is amazing. AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COST!!
1198,"Mar 15, 2022",10,"I waited for years to see Endgame. After Infinity war the expectations were very high. As an superhero movie fan, the endgame were just perfect. I saw the movie many times and i still find it very good. One of the best movie ever."
1199,"May 5, 2019",10,"This movie was EPIC!!! Seriously, Marvel could not have brought phase 3 to a close any better. I have never been one to cry at movies but this one had me in tears at different points. Whether you have followed the MCU fromthe beginning or binge watched every movie the week before (yes, you'll need at least a week), you will not be disappointed. Very excited to see what phase 4 has in store. Cheers Marvel!"
1200,"Apr 27, 2019",10,No better way to wrap up a legacy... This movie is truely flawless
1201,"May 1, 2019",6,"I was immensely disappointed with this film. Avengers: Infinity War was exciting, had a good solid plot and story. I couldn't wait to see the follow up after the unbearable cliff hanger we were left with.Avengers:End Game had none of these qualities. It felt like 2.5 hours of sentimental drivel and a 20 minute battle scene. I understand they wanted to wrap up the Avengers story but it just felt like it was more of a homage to the characters rather than a proper film. I was looking at my watch 2 hours in to see how long I had left before I could leave.The only exciting part was the battle scene and that was poorly designed and predictable. If you want to see how a good battle scene is performed watch Game of Thrones S7 E3. That was ten times more exciting than the Avengers battle scene.Special effects are always good in the Avengers films and this is no exception. It looks and sounds great. There were some amusing scenes especially involving Thor but they didn't save this disappointingly average attempt of finishing the franchise."
1202,"May 4, 2019",10,"Amazing. Absolutely amazing and heartbreaking. Triumphant. Breathtaking. And soul crushing. Someone asked me what I thought of Endgame...and all I could respond with was, there are so many words! There are so many reasons why this was the perfect superhero movie...I wouldn't have time to name them all. Do I have my gripes? Yes. I do. Maybe it's because I still haven't seen all the MCU movies that led up to this one. Or. Maybe it's because I was sitting in the front row on the right side, so I had to look at the screen as though I were watching a tennis match. Back and forth and back and forth. Whatever the case, I was in complete shock. And I laughed so hard I cried a bit. I smiled nonstop. I was so taken aback that I gasped, held my breath while covering my mouth for extended periods of time. My heart was broken multiple times to where I ugly cried uncontrollably. Even now, hours after watching the movie, I feel so destroyed by certain moments that my eyes weld with tears just thinking of those scenes. I cheers for the men who did the damn thing. I cheered for the women who banded together and rocked. I cheered for the black characters that many thought shouldn't be or shouldn't have made it. I cheered for Captain America. He was always worthy. I respect the Black Widow. I cheered for love. And second chances. This movie gave us everything we needed and more. I will watching it a million times over because every now and again, I'll need reminding that someone out there loves me 3,000."
1203,"Jul 13, 2020",9,"Marvel Studios has been the largest producer of superhero movies for the last decade, achieving something never done before, creating a universe of connected movies and that these end up cohesive at a certain point. That point would be 'Avengers Endgame'. The film is mainly about how the Avengers try to reverse the events of their predecessor 'Infinity War'. It was to be expected that Marvel Studios was up to the task in this latest installment of its franchise and it certainly is, in part. The main achievement of the film lies in how it manages to unite all its plots and give a worthy closure to each character, but despite this, the film still has an unorganic script, something that was not the case in 'Infinity War'. This script is used as a mechanism to honor this universe and its fans, but in exchange it sacrifices a more coherent narrative. It is for this reason that the greatest achievement of 'Endgame' falls on the construction of this universe, rather than on the film itself. A film that should be seen as a tribute to this path that has been traveled for more than ten years and that delivers a highly satisfying event not only for the characters, but also for the fans of the franchise."
1204,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I watched this film yesterday and am still talking about how good it is - I laughed alot, I cried even more... I cannot understand how it got any less than a 9 in the user reviews. Absolutely stunning, beautiful end to a longggg series."
1205,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Just amazing. To complete a 22 film saga, wow just wow can't do it better then this. My emotions were everywhere. I love you MCU, can't wait for what's next."
1206,"Sep 7, 2019",10,Best movie i have ever seen. This movie will be remebered for centuries.
1207,"Apr 30, 2019",6,I personally preferred most of the other movies. It was just way too predictable and not that funny.
1208,"May 2, 2019",1,These guys putting up fake reviews! End game is a waste of time and money! Weak story line! Hardly any action for thanos! Many things in the movie unexplained how they happened! Thor made a laughing stock! Why why! Big let down!
1209,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Endgame isn't just any regular super hero movie where ultimately the good guys defeat the bad guy. It's something entirely different. There's a Villain who's motive is really convincing andheroes who were defeated and are vulnerable. Ultimately it's not the triumph of good against the bad, it's the triumph of the greater good for all mankind. This is what that makes the movie unique. Russo brother's has done an outstanding job in bringing such a movie which is in a class on its own. Every single actors were excellent, but ultimately Chris Evans and Robert Downey Junior outshone every single person. Forget the negative criticism from peoples. This movie is a once in a generation event and must be seen from the theatre. Definitely it'll give you goosebumps."
1210,"Mar 15, 2020",8,"I am a post-90s generation, and I used to envy the ""previous generation"": audiences 40 years ago, the end of the Star Wars trilogy in their theaters; 20 years ago, audiences can see the ring in the theater The final chapter of the King series. The joys and sorrows of movie fans are not connected, but now we also have a common memory: Marvel Movie Universe. Thank you, Avengers."
1211,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"I have seen a lot and I mean A LOT of movies and nothing beats this movie !!! Holy hell !! I mean just absolutely loved this movie !! The movie just is flawless ! It had me at the edge of my seat, had me crying like a baby (non spoiler), the acting from everyone was absolutely flawless and Josh Brolin as Thanos was AMAZING !!! THIS MOVIE DESERVES 100000 STARS !!!! I know it's my opinion but anyone who thinks this movie was not at least good just wants to be famous for trolling cause this movie is beautiful !!!"
1212,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Had everything you could ever want from a film, emotion, comedy an amazing way to tie up some historical storylines"
1213,"Feb 18, 2020",10,"Is this the end or can the Avengers pull off one last miracle? After a 11 year journey that spans across 22 films for a total of 3000 minutes of screen time, the Marvel saga's final tale is being told (Coyle, 2019). After watching Avengers: Endgame, which is just over 3 hours long, it was very satisfying to see how all of the movies are interconnected into one movie. You will laugh and you will also cry while hanging on every word of dialogue because you don't want the movie to end. Avengers: Endgame is everything that an action hero fantasy sci-fi movie should be by finding a way to give all of the Marvel heroes a role to play in the movie. The Marvel journey began all the way back in 2008 with Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man. I think that Downey expertly portrays Tony Stark who described himself in 2012's ""The Avengers"" as a ""Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist"" by combining humor, charisma and is an absolute master at the ""one liner"". Despite Stark's many character flaws and personality quirks, he's a good man and you find yourself rooting for him. Even though there are 22 different Marvel movies, there is always a reference to Iron Man/Tony Stark.Chris Evans, who plays Cpt. Steve Rogers, aka: Captain America, does an excellent job of bringing the character to life. While Captain America is the oldest Avenger, he is also the strongest. Possibly the only person that could lift up Mjolnir, the hammer of the God of Thunder, Thor. I believe that Chris Hemsworth was destined to play the role of Thor. Standing at 6'-3"" tall with long blonde hair, he is a perfect match to Thor from the comic books.""Avengers: Endgame"" takes place 5 years after Thanos' ""snap"" that wiped out 50% of all living things. While half of the Avengers are scattered across different locations around the globe, as well as the universe, trying to pick up the pieces after ""The snap"", most of the remaining heroes are headquartered at the Avenger's base in New York. However, some of the heroes have seemed to have lost their sense of identity. One is mad at the world and is trying to rid the world of the remaining evil, while the other has turned into a slacker with a beer belly.One constant in the Marvel ""cinematic universe"" has been Stan Lee, the creator of the Marvel Universe. Sadly, Lee passed away on November 12th, 2018 and did not get to see the joy that ""Avengers: Endgame"" brought to the world. However, across the 22 movie arc, each director has found a way to give Lee a small but memorable cameo in every movie. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is no different. ""Endgame definitively closes a few chapters in the Avengers saga in highly satisfying fashion. It is a tremendously entertaining intergalactic trip"" (Warner, 2019, p.1).While ""Avengers: Endgame"" is no longer in theaters, you have multiple options to enjoy this masterpiece of a film. Marvel is now owned by Disney and can be viewed on ""Disney Plus"" for a monthly subscription of $6.99. You can also find ""Avengers: Endgame"" on Blu-Ray and DVD at any retailer for $19.99. For an overall score for ""Avengers: Endgame"", I would give it ""11 out of 10 stars"". It's just that good. This movie is rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi violence and action and some language. I think the audience needs to prepare for an emotional roller coaster while watching this movie. I think that it is helpful to understand the movie better if you have seen all of the other Marvel movies as all of the other movies are interconnected. I think ""Avengers: Endgame"" is an excellent buy because it is a fitting conclusion to the 22 movie story arc."
1214,"Mar 1, 2024",10,"This movie takes you for a ride! It picks up near immediately after Infinity War, and then does the time jump, which is very satisfying. You're able to see how each character copes with the change post-snap, which greatly humanizes them.Let's be real though, the movie hit epic levels with THE SCENE. It still gives me goosebumps.The time travel was done well. There weren't loose ends to manage, and the story does have an ending for these characters. The problem is that the bar may have been set too high. It's unlikely any future phase will ever reach this level of hype or fanfare. We spent years with these characters, and those that follow won't be bad, but just different."
1215,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Each and every character of this movie has given their contributions to the fullest that makes this movie fantastic. The credits of end game has been given to each and every characters who have been the part of the jounrey with their tireless efforts and hardwork. The screenplay of the movie is the most attracted part that enabled audience driven to this movie . This movie consists emotions that made us cry, laugh and given a wonderful experience to all the cinema lovers. Each and every dialogues made us cry and laugh that was the huge part of the movie driven the End game to success. There could be an end to the marvel universe but there is no end to love of the millions and billions of fans of marvel universe . Thank you marvel 💪"
1216,"May 2, 2019",1,I wish that everyone would get back to making action movies and try not to be so PC. There was more blue steel in this movie than zoolander. Not to mention a million plot holes.
1217,"Apr 27, 2019",9,"First of all, I have to agree on the comments that first half of this movie is really slow. There is only 10 minutes of action throughout entire 1,5 hours. However, it doesn't bore you, instead it helps you focus on characters and their feelings after they lost their friends and families because of Thanos.Remaining Avengers members try to figure out a way to undo what Thanos did. Although most of us guessed what they were gonna do, the way they do it has a lot more to offer than you can imagine. That's where things starts to refer to almost every previous Marvel movies. It makes you laugh, surprise and cry.You don't have to be a pure Marvel fan to enjoy it. Don't want to spoil it, just go and see it."
1218,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Its an amazing movie to watch. Everything is so grand. Directors binded every piece amazingly well. There's right amount of humour and seriousness and its just blend so well. Cudos to Marvel team!! A must must watch to every marvel fan and those who are not in marvel can watch for its amazing action ,humour, grand scale cinematography and What not. In short a must watch for every one!"
1219,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Loved every minute of it and I'm going to view it again! Favourite movie of all! Can't wait for more!
1220,"May 6, 2019",10,Amazing and awesome movie. Best ending after 22 movies
1221,"May 4, 2019",10,This is the best Movie. I enjoyed the film very much and appreciate.
1222,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"I must next watched a different film to many on here but let's be honest this is the kind of film that attracts a lot of fanboys and /or rivals/trolls.My opinion is not biased as I love and watch all superhero films ever since the original superman.I just felt infinity war was a much better film that didn't mess around, we got into it straight away and the ending was unlike anything I've seen before in a comic based movie. Endgame didn't deliver on many fronts, things like captain marvel playing a big part felt like I was cheated or the whole plan by Dr strange was never fully explained. There were way too many jokes even for a marvel film and one of the strongest characters Thor was the butt of all jokes thought of the film till maybe the last 5 minutes during the big fight.I think the movie reminded me of how I felt after watching matrix revolution... Just didn't live up to the hype sadly."
1223,"May 9, 2019",7,"Has a mass-market blockbuster ever opened on such a downer as this one? Infinity War's ending made anything else impossible, of course, but what one expects from such a major movie is not an hour or so of a whole set of characters learning to live with loss and grief. It's to the movie's immense credit that this sustained so long, and so well handled, to the extent that the occasional flashes of Marvel humour in that segment of the film don't seem out of place. Occasionally we pan out to the big picture and global scale of the loss. One character saying ""I miss the Mets"" brings you up short; so many have died that, even 5 years later, professional sports can not function. Another powerful moment is a scene that takes in a monument bearing the names of some of The Vanished - the monument seems endless.As well as this is handled, this wasn't my major concern ahead of the film. That revolved around what Endgame was going to do about the overwhelming loss of Infinity War. Science-fiction/fantasy stories run in to trouble, stretching credibility even in terms of their own worlds (which is the only credibility that really matters), when they get out of a narrative tight spot or emotional downbeat by pressing some kind of metaphorical 'reset button'; what happened didn't really happen, or is just undone. I feared even further when the proposed solution in Endgame started to be unpacked. In a manner of speaking, I was right to worry about this. A metaphorical reset button is pressed, but it's done in a deft way; the journey to that point is fraught with real loss that can't be undone, not to mention a bravura trip back through various points in some of the movies that have bought to this point, with scenes replayed from new angles (to say much more would be to risk too much of a spoiler). Both of these choices are well handled; as ever, this series mostly manages the dance between humour and sadness with great dexterity.The major loss of the film was genuinely moving; other losses, less so. When you have a series of films that has (so far) lasted 11 years and 21 films, and introduced (according to Wikipedia) 226 characters, there's only so much attachment one can build up to many of them. Plus I'm old, and I forget things. This is especially so in one key plot strand that ends with 2 characters having to resolve which of them will sacrifice for the other. It's a powerful moment, but to be honest I just didn't care enough about them to really be moved by what could have been a landmark moment.Much has been made in the last year or so of Marvel introducing its first film led by a black character (the excellent Black Panther) and a woman (the good but not outstanding Captain Marvel); these were indeed significant cultural moments. Endgame undercuts them somewhat by disappointingly sidelining them both for most of the film; admittedly, in the case of Captain Marvel at least, this may be as much to do with working out a reason for her immense powers not to be the solution to every problem. Even so, it doesn't really work for me; in the movie's defence in this regard, however, my 10-year old, previously superhero averse, daughter sat through it all without a toilet break or complain not once, but twice, because ""The girls kick butt!""; which is certainly true of some less central female characters.Two performances stand out for me: Josh Brolin as Thanos is brilliant, managing to imbue such a cosmic villain with pathos. Paul Rudd (Ant Man) is, for me, one of the least appreciated parts of the MCU, and his performance is superb here; great comic moments, and an occasional cypher for the more casual viewer who needs to be caught up to events. In addition, any moment in which Taika Waititi gets to give voice to his flawless comic timing as the voice of Korg is a good one; more of that, please.It's striking how little action there is for such a film; to be honest, this strained the running time for me. I think the middle third could have been contracted a little; it lagged at times. But I seem to be in a minority on that, as my daughter testifies above. For me it also suffers a little from 'Return Of The King' syndrome; there were several occasions when I thought it had finished (and wanted it to end), but another coda came along. Yes, there are a lot of character arcs to tie up; but it this is a film where neither the big picture nor micro narrative arcs are entirely smooth or neat, and the last 30 minutes or so dragged. What should have been a touching final scene for one character (and indeed the film) felt like blessed relief; other narrative developments earlier in the film were all but accompanied with a knowing nod to camera. The latter would at least have felt more in tune with the series' tone. The climactic battle isn't handled brilliantly either; there's too much going on with too many for me to really keep track of what's happening; a common fault of superhero films (Black Panther being one of the notable exceptions). I'm thinking that in this regard the makers could have learned from the flawless execution of the massed battles in the Lord of The Rings films.These are small complaints in context. We do need to take a moment to acknowledge the Marvel achievement here; when the first Iron Man movie kicked this all off 11 years ago, none of us really knew what would happen. None of us expected what has transpired; a multi-stranded, complex, overlapping set of blockbusters that (largely) standalone for the causal viewer, bring in new fans with no loyalty to the comic books (like me) and serve the hardcore fans also. To reach this point of the project and to do so as one of the biggest films of all time, with the confidence to inflict real loss on its characters and audience, is a unique cinematic achievement which, for all the faults in this film or any others in the series, is something likely to never be equalled. If anyone ever says again that modern attention spans are too short and people don't really like complex stories any more, that conversation can be ended with the sample of the Marvel films (and Game of Thrones); all we need is characters we care about, and we remain capable of following even the most complex of plots. Remember these films are serious hits amongst people much younger than me, with a far greater grasp of the narrative complexities spread over all the films. In that respect little has changed since story-telling began.There are themes and ideas to mine from this movies, and all that's gone before. Some of them will sit long in the mind, some of them give merely a fleeting suggestion. In all honesty, to really mine and understand those I'll need to revisit them all over a more condensed period of time; Endgame is certainly a film that you enjoy with a relatively limited engagement of the preceding films, but the experience will be all the richer in relation to the viewer's familiarity with the breadth of the context. For now, we come to an end that is also a rest, and a pause. We all need to take a breath."
1224,"Nov 24, 2021",8,"Simply beautiful, created wonderfully, full; satisfied plot. Great ending to the first part of a monumental franchise. Leaves us emotional and impacted."
1225,"Apr 30, 2019",7,Wanted to love this movie. I really did.All the Marvel movies have been great the last few years. Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther were superb. Infinity War was spectacular. Endgame was disappointing.Shame.
1226,"May 5, 2019",2,"Now, that a week has spend after his releasing ay theatres, i'll explain muy question in Pesce. After five or six years after this, could there be something about this movie that makes recomended, else of his hype and the marketing?I Am not a really Marvel or DC's fan, but i loved some of their movies such as; DC's: Dark Knight all, Wonder Woman, Man on Steel, Shazam. And Marvel's: Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr Strange, Winters soldier, and of Course: Infinity War. But i was waiting a lot about this, i has too big expectations, them go to the midnight releasing and i found a fast food product of movie; horrible script, horrible performance, stupid logic, terrible story. Really is this the current cinema's way? I ll'get out of this awful and cheap movie theather."
1227,"May 26, 2019",10,"Congratulations MCU on creating this 21-film cinematic feat. Was I expecting a better finish? Yes. Did I see the same movie as everyone else - it appears not. [edit: I've rewatched the movie a month later and found it more satisfying. This was the version with the post credits stuff to get us back in to push the box office into record territory. It's exactly the same movie, mind you. The character arcs are just great and the actors up to the task. My 3 key problems with the fillem are 1; The camera work for the special effects sequences are thoroughly inventive BUT the camera work for the post-trauma character studies is not inventive at all. Those scenes relied on the multi-movie character arc and sentiment more than camera direction and cinematography. Still worked for the lass behind us who was sobbing for the last third of the moofie. 2; the story is great until the time travel gobbledygook when I felt the emotive aspect lost momentum. 3; it's still hard to care as much about MCU characters as much as, say, the original Star Wars characters because in the MCU you know there's another injection of super hero greatness only months away. In the original Star Wars moofies it was years before you saw any characters again so the emotional impact was more profound. OK, so these points are all probably shrewd directorial choices and generational differences. Impressive, ambitious fillem overall] I found this move a bit of a snoozefest. The problem is, by another other movie's standards this was quite a good film. It tried for different tones and a different pace. I think a part of the problem is these movies that they shoot back-to-back. They really need a break in between films to look at the first part, ie, Infinity Wart, and see what they set up in that film. They then need to sit down and answer all of the key points that were raised in that film AND in all the previous MCU fillems. That would require a multi-layered script and a production that really turns up the ante. To me it seemed like the series really ended with Infinity Wart and this Endgame was like, the ultimate post-credits sequence. The final battle was awesome but non-sensical. Who IS the most powerful superdude/ette and why can't she (MarVel) beat Thanos? That stuff frustrates me. I mean, I was ready for the Scarlett Witch to tear him a new one but even that hope fizzled. I'll re-watch it on blu ray but I'm glad everyone else liked it. I'll always have my Return of the Jedi and Return of the King."
1228,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Awesome movie .. No words to explain ,. This is not End of an Era. ..BOOM, BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM. It is a bunch of crackers. Really a great movie.Thanks a lot my all time favorite Stan Lee.Standing aviation for our real hero Stan Lee.Iron Man Robert Drowney Jr. you are all time favorite and your really deserves OSACR. Awesome acting SIR..."
1229,"Apr 25, 2019",10,I can't express the feeling here it was the best movie i have ever seen ever. I cried so much i laugh so much i scream so much just. WOW
1230,"Mar 15, 2022",10,"So here we have it, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, the expansive sequel to not only AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR but also to the whole last 13 years or so of Marvel cinema. It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing."
1231,"Jun 7, 2020",10,This movie and Infinity War may be the most anticipated movies i've ever seen and this was simply the perfect ending.
1232,"Apr 26, 2019",10,10/10❤ Best film i've ever seen. I need to go and watch this 1 more time😍😍JUST PERFECT❤ Thank you Marvel❤
1233,"Mar 16, 2020",6,"More of the same - following Thanos' elimination of half the life in the Universe, the remaining Avengers decide to go back in time (or to an alternative time path, this is not really clear) to yet again look for the Infinity Stones so they can try to reverse the malignant halving. Since the stones are scattered around the Universe, once again a number of sub-adventures ensue, then there is yet another huge battle in which everyone in the MCU gets at least a cameo (including Captain Marvel and Scarlet Witch, so everyone else could have just gone fishing). Since the plot includes time-travel/alternate realities and infinitely powerful wish-fulfilment anything can happen, so just watch, don't think. Smart Hulk and Fat Thor are a lot less interesting than their predecessors and one can't help but wonder why the least powerful (and least interesting) Avengers are sent into space rather than participate in the more mundane search in the past (or whatever) or could the filmmakers have found an actress who looked less like a Valkyrie from Teutonic myth than Tessa Thompson. While clearly a fan pleaser, I found the film overly-long, derivative, and generally uninteresting. Too bad, as I really liked 2018's 'Infinity War'."
1234,"Feb 14, 2021",1,"This movie is so trash. There's too many different gaps in the plot, the end battle was just a large cameo to show all the different characters but didn't show the uniqueness or power capable of all the different characters."
1235,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"I can't review it, cannot be described with words, experience it yourself on theatre guys! It's really THE ENDGAME! Whatever the expectations i had, it had gone even beyond that whatsoever!!! Just watch it without knowing any spoilers! 11 years of hardwork paid off, GG Marvel!"
1236,"Sep 25, 2019",10,I'm just gonna say I don't think they could of made a better finale. Honestly every time I watch this movie I cry all the way through not even just at the emotional parts just because the story telling and build is so powerful. Will go down as one of my Favorited movies of all time. This is true film making.
1237,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"Again this is no spoilers at all, even no hints. First off I was spoiled a lot of aspects of the movie, so knew what I was expecting and still really really enjoyed it. The story and how it plays out is incredible and really clever. Rather being like infinity war with a large focus on Thanos and action scenes, this is definitely an avengers movie (the original 6 mainly) that is very character and relationship orientated. There isn't as much action until the third act and my god, the third act, imagine what you hoped for it and times it by 1000000. It's absolutely glorious. The second act was also so well done and such a fun thing to watch and piece together. The reasons why I have given it a 8 is because there are some issues I have with it, for a movie with such stakes I wish they took it a bit more seriously, and I think was too humerous and light hearted for what's going on, which meant significant tonal shifts for me personally. Also I feel like the first act was a little slow, although i perfectly understand why, and it was necessary for the story they were trying to tell but I wish there could of been an extra action sequence or something in the first act, as just a little extra. Also a scene or 2 in the third act, were a little disappointing and forced. And although there certainly is a lot of fan service in it, it makes the movie more enjoyable, although a little cliche/predictable. Overall I enjoyed this movie, it probably would of been a 9 for me if I wasn't spoiled anything. I enjoyed it just as much as infinity war, although very different movies (pacing and story wise). Would recommend for all MCU fans, however it doesn't hold your hand and you need to have watched previous movies in order for it to make complete sense, which could be a turn off for casual movie goers."
1238,"May 8, 2020",10,"I kind of couldn't like it better than the infinity war at first but now that I keep finding myself going back to watch their time jump scenes and watching the final battle scenes over and over and over again, I realized something... infinity war started with a bang - Yes, Loki dies, Thor and Hulk we powerless but cut to Dr. Strange and Wong - casually going out to as happy friends before Hulk shows up - Cut to Tony - Strolling around with Pepper discussing the wedding, Peter Parker on a school bus with his friends - Scarlett and Vision enjoying freedom - You get the point - Infinity War was about the Avengers regrouping which is why the theme of the movie was bright and why we all loved it so much but Endgame was about reclaiming which is why, the dreaded dark theme in the movie makes us feel so bad - our favorite superheroes defeated and which is why, I find myself looking for scenes after they get back together in their final attempt to undo what has been done and despite what the haters say here, that final battle will remain the biggest moment in cinematic history!"
1239,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Where to begin. This movie was everything I wanted and more. It was unpredictable, kept me guessing and was full of action and character driven moments. The story was the perfect conclusion to the characters we know and love and the epic storyline built over eleven years. There was only small nitpick I had about the movie, but to reveal it would spoil the experience that is Avengers: Endgame. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evens, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner all give 110%, as does the supporting cast. The way this film wrappes up the journies of the characters we've known for so long is beautiful. All of the characters could not have had better endings. The film is heartbreaking, exciting and well written. It's deserves all the praise it's getting. See this film, now! Before someone spoils it and because it needs to be seen on the big screen. Trust me, the climax is one of the biggest and most exciting climaxes put to film. This is the best film in the MCU, the best film of 2019 so far and will most likely continue being so and it is one of my personal favourite movies, I enjoyed it that much. 10/10. Book tickets as soon as you've finished reading this. It'll be the most exciting 3 hours of your life."
1240,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"It just blown my mind up. I screamed till i cant no more. I cried, laughed, shooked. Endgame just broken the mold. Best superhero movie ever"
1241,"Apr 30, 2019",9,"Kevin Feige and the Russo Brothers have done a fantastic job here. The film is guilty of a fair amount of inevitable plot holes, for which it cannot be considered a 10/10; yet it does a fantastic job of bringing a worthy conclusion to the 22 MCU films so far. It succeeds in juggling the many character arcs, moving pieces and increasingly complicated storylines whilst keeping the movie focused and making room for some truly thrilling action sequences in addition to many laugh-out-loud moments.It's certainly worth watching Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor 2: the Dark Wold, Avengers Assemble, Captain America the Winter Soldier or, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers Infinity War, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Doctor Strange and Thor Ragnarok at the least before viewing this film. As reflected by certain reviews, there are many parts of the film which would seem confusing or frankly boring without the knowledge of the various storylines involved, yet which will be of great interest to followers of the MCU.Having watched this film I'm truly excited for phase 4 of the direction the MCU looks to be taking going forward."
1242,"May 2, 2019",9,"This lives up to its name, great movie. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat, every part was worth watching."
1243,"Sep 2, 2019",10,I really enjoyed this movie. Not only did this movie have great actors.. very good story line and I love the way they throw in some comedy too. Enjoyable and entertaining.
1244,"May 4, 2019",10,"Hail yeah! Good! However, it was supposed to be better; Some things were not appreciated! The last part was not going to be taken.It was not allowed to end!"
1245,"Apr 27, 2019",10,The best marvel movie yet.... So many emotions.... Chill and thrill.....
1246,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"I am trying to be honest and being objective as much as I can : this movie is EPIC, I am sure ever single person in the world who has watched it will be pleased and satisfied. It was a complete emotion-packed movie.It has a few flaws, I am sure some Marvel fans feel it too, some may be annoyed by the flaws (the directors should have done this, done that, why not this, why not that, minor plot holes, etc) but all was paid off by its EPIC-ness.PS : I felt empty after I watched the Endgame, even until I write this review. It is not because I don't like the movie, it is just because I am not sure whether the next MCU saga will be as GREAT and EPIC as this. Good luck for the future MCU !!"
1247,"May 2, 2019",6,"It is awesome, fantastic, but it was not as great as infinity war"
1248,"May 1, 2019",7,"For a movie with high score review and expecting to have a higher score than the Dark Knight for the MCU lovers, it's too standard although as concept is not bad."
1249,"Apr 30, 2019",1,"Too long, too boring, too many special effects versus substance. Bad jokes Don't don't waste your money or time."
1250,"Dec 18, 2019",9,"If you are a fan of the mcu you will love this movie even if your not you might still love it, it concludes the story that was being told since 2008 in a satisfying way. It is more than a movie this is an experience especially in theaters"
1251,"May 6, 2019",10,Endgame nicely sums up all the previous films to give a satisfying end to a wonderful saga of movies. Couldn't asked for any more. Thank you Russos and all the production team and cast.
1252,"Apr 28, 2019",10,This is the perfect ending for the infinity saga as they call it ...I enjoyed every second .. multiple goosebumps... tears ...laughs... it is truely awesome and got no words that could describe how I feel ... loved it so much ...thank you marvel ... thank you so much.
1253,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"No words, it had everything that you could want in a film. Cant predict what's going to happen either."
1254,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Watched the trailer and I went there to see lots of actions, jokes and CGI but It was something totally UNPREDICTABLE, it was a beautiful story well made for ages to come with touching key moments. It was very accurate to the comics, this was the real avengers made by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee. The actors performance and dialog was top notch, especially Robert Downey Jr and Scarlett Johansson. Thank you for this beautiful movie."
1255,"Apr 25, 2019",10,Such an emotional movie.. after 11 years of battle members of avenger and this is the end..
1256,"Apr 24, 2019",7,"7.2/10 👍🍿 I admit, this movie was good. I didn't like infinity War but this was an improvement on both Sadness and characters. Black Widow and Hawkeye were much better in this than any other film!"
1257,"Aug 9, 2019",1,Love most of the marvel movies so far (except captain marvel) but this was a total let down :(
1258,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"I might be going a little bit too far by saying this but this might be my favorite movie ever. It's all personal opinion of course but I grew up with the mcu and seeing the conclusion of 22 films really made me feel all warm inside, it brought back memories of seeing the first Avengers movie or hell even seeing the first Iron Man. The payoffs are fantastic and it wraps everything up nicely. Overall I'm impressed that marvel can make this big of a movie and not have it fall flat on its face."
1259,"May 29, 2020",10,Seems to be a lot of People expecting a No colour mute drama from the 20's. This move is simply amazing! 10/10 👏👏
1260,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"If there was any way to end this Marvel series of movie's, this was it! That's alI I can say...you all NEED to see it for yourselves, to experience all the emotions. Everyone did a fantastic job!"
1261,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Poogers to directors for auch a great job 3hrs well spent This movie really shiwed where mcu started and where it ia going
1262,"Apr 28, 2019",7,"Overall its a good movie and may be an okay finale, it seems like the Seinfeld finale, after a great run a disappointing end, the movie story didnt have fluidity and seems the writers just wanted to finish all endings quickly rather than the smooth flow like in infinity war"
1263,"Nov 29, 2019",10,The way they planned it from past 10 years was amazingly good and there's nothing better than this.
1264,"Feb 26, 2021",1,"Watching Avengers Endgame, What Did People See In This! Avengers Endgame! I really don't like soap operas! Boring!"
1265,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I cried so hard during the whole thing, and it was worth it. I loved every aspect of the movie and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much!!"
1266,"May 3, 2019",10,My year movie until today Last scane was perfect and nice ending
1267,"Apr 25, 2019",10,Best film ever? Best film ever. BEST FILM EVER? BEST FILM EVER.
1268,"Apr 28, 2020",9,Amazing cast amazing performances...its successful not just as a superhero movie but as a film in general
1269,"May 5, 2019",10,"Perhaps one of the best, even the best movie I have ever seen!"
1270,"Sep 10, 2020",6,"It did its job at providing a satisfying conclusion for the quadrilogy. I don't think that it does anything exceptional or bad. Actually, that's not true. It does one thing exceptionally: It's three hours but I never felt the runtime. And it does something bad: The fat suit for Thor looked soooo fake.And I personally thought what they did with the Hulk was hilarious.But I'm honestly sick of Marvel at this point. I'm sick of superheroes and supervillains and the whole interrupting the plot to make a joke thing. And I can only see myself watching this again if someone else wants to watch it. I'm glad The Boys is a thing!"
1271,"Jun 7, 2019",3,"Reaching for the stars, failed to take off from the orbit."
1272,"Jun 30, 2019",10,The Best Marvel Movie Ever... .............................Nuf Said- Stand Lee
1273,"May 5, 2019",10,"Show some respect, I mean the movie is the best of its generation 3000 times. Why do people give it down ratings?!! This movie deserves the most 3000 more than you do."
1274,"Sep 15, 2019",9,I saw it in theaters with my kid. We were both laughing and crying on the edge of our seat.
1275,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I will write this without giving a single spoiler. As many of us Marvel fans have started this journey over 10 years ago, I can confidently say that we have grown up and grown so very attached to each character. We've connected with these Superheroes on so many levels, love, joy, happiness, and so many laughs. I'm usually a tough critic with movies, but I cannot say any other than this wasn't just an amazing Marvel movie; But an amazing movie in general. Every aspect of this movie brings you so much closer to the Hero's we fell in love with as children and showed us why they are hero's. This is a must watch Movie. And as funny as this sounds, this Superhero movie was Beautiful, thought invoking, motivational and so very loving. We could not have asked for anything better. Lastly I will say is, Marvel gave us a perfect start to the world of Marvel and most importantly a complete and perfect start. I honestly want to thank every single person involved with this masterpiece and say how much I appreciate what we e been given."
1276,"Apr 24, 2019",9,Privileged to be one of the first in the world to watch it 18 hours ago. It was amazing. A whole 3 hours worth of a movie
1277,"May 4, 2019",10,"For the closeup of the avengers movie, you can't find a better way. Get stick to your chair for for ride of your life."
1278,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This movie took my expectations and shattered them. I was stuck glued to the theater screen for all 3 hours not wanting to look away or blink. The perfect blend of humor, action, and emotionally powerful scenes. At first I was finding to tough to believe they would be able to surpass the events of Infinity War, but I knew the Russo Brothers and great team behind this movie were gonna be able to pull it off. And they did just that. The hour of the movie left me with tears of joy and tears of sadness at the time. By the time I was leaving the movie theater my eyes were and stingy due to the amount of tears I had cried. As someone who has been watching MCU movies since the very beginning and seen every single one this move was true worth the 10+ year wait. Could not be happier."
1279,"May 8, 2019",1,"Indulgent rubbish. Do yourself a favor and just watch infinity war because this film is boring and by the end, I just did not care anymore!"
1280,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"Even if i really loved infinity war and i consider it to be one of best comic book films ever made in scale and heart,but i must say that i loved endgame even more since it doubled all that things and made them even better,and it give us great conclusion to the era of mcu since 2008,endgame had brilliant actors that did a marvelous job and i think that werent any weak link,thanos maybe less focused then in infinity war but still he was able to bring staff that we love about him,this film also has some very sad moments with emotional punch but i think that they did a great job in closing characters arcs and stories,sure there is some staff about time traveling that is messy but in this kind of film i simply dont care"
1281,"May 12, 2019",8,"Truly amazing, i love how it was done in three parts. Act one dealing with the loss, act two getting the team and plan together and act three all out brawl for redemption!!!"
1282,"Apr 28, 2019",10,It was great. More than just an superhero action movie. Thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie.
1283,"Apr 27, 2019",8,"More emotional than infinity war, fight scenes still good though, writing is a little more reliant on plot devices compared to the previous film but they throw in a good amount of comedy"
1284,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"After 21 movies, this epic saga has come to an end. Avengers Endgame is one of the finest superhero movie ever made. The movie perfectly captures what made this franchise so unique and dear to all the fans. The movie is packed with humor, emotional moments and offcourse some epic battles. Those who are the old fans will obviously love this movie but the new ones who haven't seen any marvel movie would still find something good. Overall this movie is not just an movie but an experience. An experience of lifetime which can only be enjoyed on the largest screen possible."
1285,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"The best of marvel, a rollercoaster of emotions im not yet recovered of this epicness. Very good even if you dont like suoerheroes movies"
1286,"Apr 30, 2019",6,"They made it that way on purpose, so that most people would have to say ""yes, we think we understand, yea..."" so not to look like a bunch of idiots. There's power in the denial! But go watch it for the laughs, I'm not a type of person to cringe over a cheesy joke, but whoever was responsible for comedy relief this time around has gotten to me! Was it RDJ? He a genuinely funny guy.I rate this sci-fi fantasy: 6/10 -1 for over the top CGI, -2 for deus ex machina, -1 for trying to make me feel for too many characters! Because I can't do lazy writing. and -1 for shameless AUDI plug but I won't go below 6."
1287,"May 5, 2019",10,Amazing movie. I really enjoyed it. it had a lot of avengers assembling to beat the mad titan THANOS
1288,"Apr 30, 2019",1,More than half of the movie is boring with a very bad script
1289,"May 26, 2019",10,Don't listen to these trolls. If you've been a fan of the MCU you will love this. The one star reviews are absolutely ridiculous. The least you could give this movie is a 7 star rating.
1290,"May 5, 2019",9,"A masterful epic that not only concludes the past 10 years, but also sets up the future of the MCU. Avengers Endgame delivered an outstanding and creative story while still adding meaningful conclusions and new beginning to our favorite characters. 9/10"
1291,"May 19, 2019",10,"There have been few Marvel movies that I vaguely liked, and over the years, I've fallen asleep through many. I straight up didn't understand some of them, and none of them did I genuinely enjoy the whole way through.Except this one. This one is different. It is the only one that made me care about anything that was happening. Spending a lot of time on story/emotional development in the first hour made me care about what happened the last two. And it flew by, didn't even notice. I cried, laughed and actually cheered/rooted during the last fight scene.Best one of the bunch for me. Glad it could wrap up on a high note."
1292,"Apr 27, 2019",8,"Movie is a little long. There are scenes that could have been made shorter or cut out completely. A LOT of exposition. Feels like we're being spoon fed what they are planing to do the majority of the movie. A cringe worthy feminist girl moment that makes your eyes roll. There was no subtlety there. The movie was a little messy with pacing but show a lot of heart.There were two characters that I took a little issue with. Captain Marvel- Irritating and nasty with the few lines she does have. Really felt Brie Larson bleeding through the character with comments like ""well, you didn't have me last time"". I feel no respect for this character or actress and hope they remove her sooner rather than later.Thor- Funny but the character seems to be dumbed down a little too much. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan and enjoy humor but this schtick went on a little too long.This movie has a lot of really solid comedy, heart felt moments, and action. Yeah it has some plot holes but the over all story is good and a fair way to end Phase 4."
1293,"May 25, 2020",10,"This is WAY better than Infinity War, my opinion though. But Thor-bawski was played for laughs too much."
1294,"Apr 29, 2019",8,"Really really enjoyed watching Endgame. Captain Marvel is a distant memory. Despite Brie Larson being featured in Endgame it was only in a couple of scenes so it wasn't too bad. Endgame is incredibly sad, sometimes funny but very entertaining. Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Karen Gillan steal every scene their in. Will definitely watch again. Hopefully in phase 4 Captain Marvel will take a back seat just like Endgame."
1295,"Jul 5, 2019",10,Its best movie I have ever watched that's all I have to say #Endgame
1296,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"What a way to end this phase of Marvel. Comedy, Action, Drama, Romance, and Sadness all rolled into a single movie. Great job marvel."
1297,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"The movie isn't about fight but it's about the struggle they have made for each other and the familys who have been vanished. And they actually did ""whatever it takes"""
1298,"May 5, 2019",10,"This was an emotional roller coaster, extremely good. It had just the right amount of comedy, sadness, excitement, and everything in between to make you remember this movie forever. I would definitely recommend you to watch, although I have to say, what the hell were you all doing with your lives if you still didn't watch it yet."
1299,"Oct 11, 2019",10,This movie is amazing! Its a must see movie! Please watch this movie it has so much fun and exciting things in it.
1300,"Apr 26, 2019",10,I LOVED every minute of Endgame. Thank you for such an amazing ride!
1301,"Jun 4, 2020",10,Again a best movie from Marvel.. But it has some drawbacks but also a It will be a beautiful experience to watch our superheroes..
1302,"May 8, 2019",6,Good film. It could be great if there was not that much idiot jokes and that Thor was threared as non idiot. And everyone who says this is better than Nolan's trilogy is idiot. Anyone who says this is better than Man of steel or BvS or Watchmen is also an idiot.
1303,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"Finally it's here. But not the finale we deserve. The story is quite thin, the action is scarce and the 3+ hours is too much. The humor saves the movie. Without humor it would have been a total disaster. This should have been the finale that would be epic. Looks like they where going for the quick money instead of waiting to perfect it. Sad to see it end like this."
1304,"Jun 4, 2019",4,Listen I'll take X-Men over the avengers any day. boring characters
1305,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame is better than I ever could have imagined!!! A love letter to the past decade with so many Easter eggs, just an absolute joyride. The last half hour is a spectacularly jaw-dropping, emotional, goosebumps-filled piece of cinema unlike anything we've seen thus far!! (A forever Christmas gift for my 10-yr old self)Marvel closed this out by pitching a perfect game!! Just ... wow. This 22-film story arc has been an amazing ride! Thank you, Marvel and everyone involved with the making of these films! #ThankyouAvengers"
1306,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"I'm not giving you spoilers: this was everything you expected and hoped for. This is the most satisfying and inspiring end. This masterpiece brings you joy, tears, excitement and so much more. You definitely have to see it. When I first saw it Wednesday night, I was so overwhelmed that I've decided to see it again this Thursday!!"
1307,"Jun 26, 2020",10,"There's only one word to describe Avengers endgame and it's EPIC. The scale of this movie is incredible. Well deserved to be the highest grossing film of all time. Watching Endgame in the cinema was the best movie experience I have ever had. I'm so incredible impress how they manage to wrap all those movies in such a satisfying way. If you aren't a marvel fan or haven't seen the other movies I'm sure you will enjoy it just from the incredible action, entertaining story, amazing CGI, the performances and so on."
1308,"May 14, 2019",10,"Best of what anyone would just imagine, best everything totally loved this movie enjoyed every single second of movie"
1309,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Such a beautiful way to end such a fantastic series...or, rather, to end this chapter. Marvel has really outdone themselves and no other film could put that many avengers/superheroes on one screen and make it that good. I hope you haven't spoiled the movie for yourself if you are at all hesitant...whether it be fear of disappointment or not wanting to sit there for 3+ hours. Anyone that has kept up with all the movies will be blown away. Thank you Russo Brothers for making such a beautiful film."
1310,"May 3, 2019",6,"I admit I had fairly high expectations for this movie, but in this instance I find it justified given the buildup to this particular movie.To put it shortly, it is inferior to Infinity War in every way. I've seen infinity war probably 8 times now and Endgame makes me appreciate it even more. The pacing and execution of Infinity War is incredible in comparison. Infinity war felt like a much more mature movie in that there are moments that still make me feel sadness for the characters and the pacing of the movie was far better. Endgame felt all over the place. There were moments I wanted to tear up but the scenes didn't feel adequate to really draw a reaction. They moved on far too quickly and the movie itself was choppy. It was hard to really relate to the characters. When I first saw Infinity War I wondered how they would handle so many characters in one film and be able to still have the audience empathize with them, but any doubts were laid to rest. This movie is pretty much the worst case scenario for how to handle many characters.Don't get me wrong, there were parts that were quite satisfying, which is hard to go into further detail about without divulging too much information.All in all this movie was saved by particular scenes and those few moments of feeling resolution. It felt more childish in execution and appeal and Infinity War felt more mature than the typical Marvel movie. When I saw Captain Marvel I really disliked it, but I thought it was a one off and they would be redeemed with Endgame. This was not the case.Definitely see it, and see it in theatres if you can, just don't go in with the highest of expectations."
1311,"May 2, 2019",1,"It's like they wrote the script after 3 AM the day before the deadline. This is the worst Marvel MCU film ever. Even Age of Ultron was seriously better than this,"
1312,"Aug 9, 2024",10,"1. Overall Plot - 9/10 I love the plot of this movie. It is so entertaining and nostalgic. I love how this movie is just go, go, go. It starts right after infinity war, which I like. This is a phenomenal end to the MCU and Infinity Saga.The only reason this isn't a ten is because this movie is full of plot holes. I don't think this takes away from the experience at all, and it is still very enjoyable. But it's definitely not a perfect movie.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 10/10 This is as entertaining as it gets. It takes the hype of all the MCU prior and builds it up to this amazing climax.You get really engaged while watching this, because the stakes are so high. Anything can happen at anytime, so you are in it the whole time.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 10/10 This movie has so much emotion in it. It drives the story. I don't ever really cry in movies, but this one gets me close.You get really invested in this movie. Because of how much buildup there is, and the high stakes, you get really into it.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 9/10 This has so many great themes in it. Not giving up. Sacrifice. Getting over yourself for the greater good. And doing whatever it takes to triumph over evil.This movie isn't super deep, but is still pretty deep. It is the final climax of over ten years of films. This is what it has been leading too.5. Characters - 6/10 This is what hurts the fim the most. Because half the Avengers are blipped we don't really get to see them that much, so that's a bummer.This movie ruined Thor and Hulk. The completely changed Thor's character and ruined him. By making him fat and depressed he feels nothing like he should. And it doesn't really make sense, because he has lost so much before, that this loss isn't even the biggest one for him. They wanted him to be a funny comic relief character, but that doesn't fit well with his character or the movie at all. Hulk was also ruined. Nobody wanted or needed to see Smart Hulk. He is so much better as Bruce Banner and Hulk separately. Mixing them is just asking for stupid scenes with bad CGI.They also ruined Captain America in the end of the film. How they just cut him off and gave him such a quick ending is bad. It is also a major plot hole.Most other characters are great.6. Acting / Writing - 10/10 There isn't a bad actor in this. Everyone is amazing. Because Mark Ruffalo is Smart Hulk, it makes his acting hard to even tell it's bad. And Brie Larson as Captain Marvel is barely in the movie, so she doesn't bring it down.The writing is great. Some of the dialog does create some plot holes, but that doesn't take away from the entertainment of the film at all.7. Cinematography / Sets - 10/10 The cinematography in this is so good. There is some amazing shots that are super memorable. I love how the whole movie was filmed in Imax too.I love all the different settings in this. We get to travel all around the Universe in this and it makes it super entertaining. The final fight is also set in a very cool spot. It is very reminiscent of a comic book fight.8. Score / Sound - 10/10 The music is amazing. It is very epic.9. Editing / Pace - 10/10 This movie is edited very well, and I have no complaints.The pacing is great. You are never bored, and it is just action throughout. It's a very very entertaining movie. This movie is three hours long, but doesn't feel like it at all. It could honestly be longer and it would still be good.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 9/10 The effects are so good in this. But they could be just a bit better. There was a few times that I noticed something that didn't look very good. Especially Smart Hulk. He doesn't look as bad as Hulk has looked, but it could still be better. Hulk has never looked as good as he did in the Incredible Hulk.Average Score: 9.3/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts: 9.9/10 I love this movie. It is one of the best MCU movies. The reason it isn't the best is because it is only as good as it is because of the buildup. The movie itself as a standalone film definitely isn't perfect. This is a great love letter and ending to the amazing MCU. After the Infinity Saga. Besides the two Spider-Man films, the MCU has not been that good. And nothing will ever top the significance of Endgame as a film."
1313,"May 4, 2019",10,"This film, to me, is damn near perfect. Yeah it has a few nitpicky things wrong with it, but it's wrapping up twenty-two films!!You're not going to see a film of this magnitude again for at least another decade!It's sweet, it's funny, it's exciting, and you can't even feel time passing. It's a thrill from beginning to end."
1314,"May 5, 2019",9,"Endgame really makes you look at all the movies as a whole series of events with an outcome. It makes all the movies come together in a way that makes everything better. They really did something special with Endgame, especially with the challenges they had going into it."
1315,"Jul 30, 2019",10,Avengers Endgame is an SUPER AWESOME movie . It actually made me cry and I'm a crying person.
1316,"May 3, 2019",9,"The dedication and acting of the cast was incredible! The score was phenomenal! Such a heartbreaker and a tear. Great movie, I do think infinity war was better."
1317,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Marvel really stepped up its game in this movie and it was a great wrap up to phase 3 of the MCU. I love the effects and the whole movie in general 10/10
1318,"May 3, 2019",10,"Excellent storyline! References to the past, super heroes getting emotional too was a surprise! Unpredictable story line! Going to watch again"
1319,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"After Infinity War I was worried about how Endgame would take the second half after the snap and I loved it. It was happy, it was sad, I laughed and I cried and I felt the characters and their stories went exactly where they needed to to. Bravo, Marvel!!"
1320,"Apr 14, 2023",10,"I spent 10 years of my life watching the Infinity Saga. 10 years from the age of 15, through to my mid 20s. 10 years watching every release without fail, every mid and post credit scene, every trailer and teaser. I spent countless hours reading theory's, watching YouTubers find Easter eggs and reading comics to help piece it all together.I don't even care that some might not be as good as others, they all told one big story. Every single one of these films means so much to me and I can barely put into words the part they have played in my life. I found confidence in myself by having this amazing shared experience with so many others and I will never forget those incredible 10 years.No matter where life may take me, these films are home."
1321,"Oct 5, 2019",10,"Another MCU all time blockbuster!!!Just want to say if you miss this one, you will surely miss your way to HEAVEN. This is the ultimate heaven! Go and watch incredible journey of Robert Downey Jr & his team's performance."
1322,"May 21, 2019",9,"This movie, pretty much, had it all...great action and drama...heroic valor...and comedy, in all the right places... plus there were great cameos...it's long, but it doesn't seem as long as it is because the pacing is very good... definitely recommeneded."
1323,"Apr 27, 2019",6,"The first 2 acts dragged out too much, they could cut about 15 min. But the worst part is that the 3rd act is predictable, but with great moments. I really thought there would be some kind of surprise, but there weren´t. I wished I loved this movie so bad, but I was so disappointed with the film. It had great moments but also much meh moments."
1324,"Apr 25, 2019",6,"Was a good movie but it just needed a bit more to it, it wasn't as good as they said it would be and not much really happened."
1325,"Aug 14, 2019",3,They could have cut an hour and a half of the slow unimportant scenes.
1326,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Absolutely superb film! So brilliantly filmed. An amazing ending to the Avengers storyline. Rollercoaster of emotions but defiantly a must see!
1327,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"The film was very beautiful. It combines drama, action and comedy. It was a very nice mix so far. It is certainly the best film of MCU films and also the best film I have seen so far this year."
1328,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"As the ending of such a wonderful saga, Endgame surely is breathtaking and magnificent. The storyline flows and the timeline all well made, the acting performance is awesome, and though it's also heartbreaking not give you what you want, but it give you what you need. It's like the journey of life, where the ride bring you up and down, tears and joys, laugh and cries, but it the end, you get what you need. Not always what you want, but what you need."
1329,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I just came back boi , nothing to say im speechless to the bone! All what i can say , ""expect the unexpected"" stay strong my dear MCU fans because #whateverittakes ! Idk what to do with my life anymore , thank you for reading this! i shall go cry in bed bye"
1330,"May 6, 2019",10,It was The best film I wached I like all of marvell comany films but it was diffrent this film exited me and I really like it
1331,"Apr 28, 2019",9,"What can I say but ""Thank you, Marvel""?I really recommend you to watch all MCU movies before Endgame, because they make this experience unique for the fans that is with them since the beginning.About the movie, I'm thinking for a long time to write an adjective, but the only one I can think for now is ""wordless"".I had never seem something like this, even in Infinity War (which I thought it was insurmountable) we didn't watch such a deep and emotional movie like I just watched in Endgame.All characters have a great end in the film. I can say that them fulfilled the role just the way it should be. We don't see individual throughts, but a team working together to save what they love more.It was a pleasure to be part of this, because all of us has something in these Marvel movies. Maybe grateful is the word to discribe the feeling right now. I claped my hands when the screen turns black and I know that a lot of fans, like me, did the same!Thank you, Marvel for the Gran Finale."
1332,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"Avengers Endgame for me, was good but not so good, it was fun but not so fun, it was exciting but not so exiting, it was emotional but just a little bit. From the get go it tries to establish things that are confusing. For me it broke the #1 code that made Marval movie great - don't break your own fictional universe's rules. Endgame breaks quite a few rules and I ended up at the finale waiting for explanation which never really fully came.I did enjoy the movie, and at parts the movie delivered what it promised but it's by no means as great as I was hoping it would be.For years we fans have speculated and analyzed what would happen. Take any simplest of the theory and that is what happens. It left me disappointed. It left me disappointed that Russo brothers went with a average at best storyline.Infinity War was sort of a standalone movie, a person with basic knowledge of previous movies could watch it and enjoy it. This one, you need to know the entire plot until now. Even then this movie is not as good as the previous avenger movies.Endgame is good and has lots of fan service but the humor seems forced and the story seems questionable. It might have worked if it didn't have such grand expectations but since it does, it is still a disappointment for me.Verdict: 6/10"
1333,"May 3, 2019",10,Not much to say Awsome movie time flew while watching it. Rollercoaster ride of emotions. Well done.
1334,"Apr 27, 2019",10,I must say when I sat down to watch Endgame I was expecting something else. This movie totally went left an once that plot was unraveled I literally feared for the hero's because Thanos isn't just any enemy. He's brutal. Couldn't have asked for a better ending to the infinity wars. Loved it
1335,"May 2, 2019",6,This movie is very boring for at least the first hour and forty five minutes
1336,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Crying, happy and sad. never have I sat so far out on the chair. Incredibly nice ending to an incredible universe."
1337,"Aug 28, 2021",3,I think that it felt like a long film and it really had a predictable ending. Although the film felt long it also felt rushed there was a real lack of thought that went into this film as it really didn't seem to excite me. Generally I would say that the cinematography was poor and the acting was ok at best. For the amount of money Marvel have they really did really make a quality film.
1338,"Nov 12, 2021",9,"It was unexpected, infinity war was really different to this but I like this concept, since it has to do with time travel we get to adventure back in the MCU, infinity war was the big 10 year film and this was part 2, instead of being a giant action film there was also time traveling witch means we can go a trip down memory lane and see some of the past of the MCU, this makes for a great big movie that has had this much leading up to it. The climax was also really awesome, it was just the biggest fight ever! Generally a different movie than infinity war, but still solid."
1339,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"22 films. 11 years.Drama, action, comedy, in 1 film.3 hours 2 minutes.Amazing!Ps : dont wait for post credits scene"
1340,"Oct 25, 2019",10,This a generational wonder and kids will never understand in coming years how much this meant.
1341,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I belive that ... the best movie is coming and i so many time wait for it i love All the charachtars in this movie it will became the best movie for ever
1342,"May 5, 2019",4,They should have called it Captain America: end game Every scene is oriented to that useless character
1343,"May 4, 2019",10,"Emotional, exhausting, funny heartbreaking. From beginning to end it takes you through all the emotions and ends 11 years of films brilliantly. Never had a film that gives me chills at so many different points. So worth the wait and definitely lives up to the hype. Visually stunning"
1344,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Thank you avengers,Specially Iron Man who taught us patience and fight 😭😭😭😭😭😭 #foreverfirday"
1345,"Apr 27, 2019",8,Hyper ratings are not realistic it wont go over 8.5 for me
1346,"Oct 9, 2023",10,"I'm writing this review on 2023. I know it's late, but I gotta say is that. Marvel studios is failed after endgame. They've failed in making a good movies like hulk, captain America, iron man, Thor. All they make is cringe hulk, low cost V F X, bad story. It's hard see our favourite comic studio is failing. And they make is coco - melon type movies. This is masterpiece from marvel. It's happy to see every heroes together and fighting thanos. It's absolutely fantastic and mind blowing. The story, the film making, the dialogues is absolutely incredible. I'd highly recommend this movie for anyone."
1347,"Sep 28, 2019",9,"I do not see why everyone was giving the plot of this movie a 1 or 2 star. I can say watching this movie for 3 hours, it tied up all the previous movies all in one bow and left no questions unanswered. I think some viewers wanted more death scenes but for me I was truly satisfied and entertained since watching all the marvel movies at the start of first Ironman. You will definitely try to hold back some tears which I was good at but this movie will try to make you cry. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did since this is the last avengers saga."
1348,"Apr 28, 2019",10,I won't put in spoilers just that I love Marvel and I was blown away by how amazing this movie was. Reached all my expectations and more. It deserves all the praise it's getting.
1349,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Endgame is absolutely the most touching and with most emotional elements among those 22 movies. And you can see the character's personal spiritual growth in these three hours. People who are brave, arrogant or selfish, they all become differently. All in all, it is the most significant moment in MCU. AND DON'T FORGET TO BRING TISSUE PAPER, you properly will cry if you have been follow all these 22 movies in this decade."
1350,"Jun 12, 2020",8,"I love this movie. Even though it Iis quite sad in some areas, they could still fit it some jokes."
1351,"Apr 28, 2019",10,This film was so much fun & love how Thanos was finally defeated once & for all.
1352,"Apr 27, 2019",10,I think it would disrespect the movie if you write something about this movie...
1353,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"Infinity War is just too big of a movie to overcome & Endgame suffers from trying to do it. The pacing was bad. Some characters are misrepresented & their arcs are ruined by doing so. Somehow this movie can't handle the amount of characters in it, but it's predecessor do it really great. Disappointing."
1354,"Apr 24, 2019",10,This is the best film I've ever seen from the beginning of the film marvel until this film many scenes that amazed me
1355,"Apr 26, 2019",7,The first part was much better. This one feels like a letdown!
1356,"Apr 28, 2019",4,"A film with a great closure but that does not surpass its predecessor in terms of quality refers to it, although it is true that we should not let go of fanaticism the film is good but it is not to be considered a jewel or that it is above several cult movies"
1357,"Jun 26, 2019",10,"Simply the greatest happening in the world of cinema / geek / nerd.A work derived from a long planning, a great study and great production, gathering all these actors, tying a giant script and closing with giant surprises and golden key, is for few!Thank you MARVEL for inviting me to become a film industry professional, thanks to this infinity saga I chose my profession, and my reference is you, thank you!"
1358,"Dec 6, 2021",8,I went into this movie fully expecting that it can't top infinity war and I was mostly right but it was still a great movie and had an amazing climax and a way to end the series.
1359,"Jul 8, 2020",10,This was one of the greatest movie experiences of all time for me.
1360,"May 6, 2019",10,Amazing movie 10/10 would watch again ending was sad tho
1361,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"The movie is nothing less than a 10, if anyone says otherwise they crazy. I mean it's so cool, it has everything. A true mcu fan will most definitely cry because its simply amazing......"
1362,"Apr 24, 2019",7,Long movie. It was good but not great unless your under 25
1363,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Right, this film is excellent. I would say I preferred Infinity War, as it was right in your face from the beginning. Now Endgame, has a lot of build up. So all that rubbish about not being able to go for a pee, in fear of missing something. Do so in the first two hours.Watch out for the peanut butter sandwich."
1364,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I had high hopes and was not let down. It's emotionally draining, I needed an hour afterwards just to get back to normal. Perfection folks. See this movie."
1365,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"This film is hard to talk about without spoiling it, it is a 3 hour movie and the furthest I'll go in terms of talking about what is in the movie, is to say that we have seen nothing of it from the trailers. The movie is very heartfelt, and that's performed by the excellent character development. Throughout the years of the MCU, you feel like you know these characters, but not that personally, and this film definitely fills the missing gap there. We actually get to see these characters not fighting, doing things many of us wouldn't imagine and it makes these guys we have seen on the big screen for the past 11 years so much more lovable. This movie is also truly ror the fans, coming into this movie with not much knowledge about Marvel wouldn't make you feel the same way of the movie that a fan would in terms of understanding and emotions. Avengers: Endgame is pieced together masterfully, by the Russo Brothers, who I must acknowledge for directing a movie like this. They did an excellent job with pacing, plot and keeping the whole 3 hours completely discrete and unpredictable. This movie very much feels like a culmination of what the past 11 years, and 22 movies in the MCU have lead up to. The final act is absolutely astounding, and really shows you what the MCU has come to, being one of my favourite scenes from not only all of the MCU but also that I've ever seen. Make sure not to miss a single minute of this movie, with all of it being important. This movie was so close to being perfect, making the right choices, bringing an emotional tone we've never had before and so much more that worked, but there were a few tiny problems. Firstly, CGI seems a little bit off in some or the scenes, which is a bit disappointing but minor enough to the point that no casual watcher would notice. Second, some of their jokes just don't land, especially in one scene at the very end. Third, it feels like it could be a bit shorter, with some scenes in the second half that didn't really matter. Overall, this movie is astounding, but only for Marvel fans. The 3 hours doesn't feel that long whatsoever, maybe feeling a bit long towards the end, but the movie keeps to be very entertaining all the way throughout. Avengers: Endgame is the best representation of Marvel as a whole, and is easily the best MCU movie yet, with Captain America: Civil War right below it. There are many theories online, and I'm aware of most of them, I can confirm that nearly all of them aren't even close or barely play a part in the movie. It definetely will hold up as the best movie of 2019, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the MCU. Keep in mind, there's no after credits, it doesn't matter how long you stay. Besides, the very final scene itself feels like an after credits scene."
1366,"May 1, 2019",10,"This movie is near perfect. It doesn't work without the MCU films that came before it, but if you've seen them all, WOW. packs a serious emotional punch. Fun, funny, sad, I got all the feels."
1367,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"If you thought Avengers: Infinity War (2018) was as best as it could get then you're sadly mistaken. Endgame doesn't disappoint, with amazing references, those one liners and a pinch of comedy; this film is definitely setting high standards. The perfect balance between drama and action. A must watch!"
1368,"Jun 18, 2020",7,This movies was not bad but after seeing Infinity War I was expecting better. 7/10
1369,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I'm so grateful that in my lifetime I'm able to follow this journey of a epic superhero story. I salute every single one that made this possible from the beginning. It's not easy to keep all the actors working together over a few years to deliver something as big as this. And there isn't a single thing that I don't like about this movie. I won't say more but I believe many of you will be blown away like I was. Go watch it!!
1370,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Everyone who is giving less than 10 is stupid , dum and can't understand this movie"
1371,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"The best movie of the Marvel Cinematic universe.., Power packed with comedy, emotions, action.... etc. All the cast and crew are worked hard. I think everybody go and watch the movie.. Experience it in IMAX 3D"
1372,"May 6, 2019",9,Was everything I expected and more! Awesome movie.
1373,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Hell yes! The inner comic buff in me was screaming out the whole time.
1374,"Apr 26, 2019",10,I will not spoiled anything from my heart I love 3000
1375,"Sep 24, 2024",8,"In this epic conclusion to the Avengers saga, Chris Evans reprises his role as Captain America. After the devastating events of Infinity War, the Avengers are trying to undo what Thanos did, and Cap is one of the key players. What makes this film so special for Evans' character is how it wraps up his entire journey. We see Cap at his most heroic, leading the team and fighting for what's right, but also dealing with a lot of personal dilemmas.The film is packed with action, emotional moments, and some incredible character arcs. Evans shines in his final moments as Cap, especially in that last scene where he decides to live the life he never got to have. The time travel storyline is a bit tricky, but overall it's a satisfying end to his journey as the leader of the Avengers."
1376,"Feb 29, 2020",10,There are many problems in this movie but the authors did everything they could to end the very phase of this big universe in logical way.
1377,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"Avengers Endgame is a perfect farewell packed with emotions and grandeur, Must watch for Marvel Fans..."
1378,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Lived up to expectations. Every single minute of the movie had me wondering what was going to happen next. Enough movement in the storyline that it never was boring. But I will say, bring your tissues!!"
1379,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Best superhero movie ever made, i laugh, i cried, it gave me goosebumps, just an outstanding movie, pure art by Russo Brothers, great ending for a great series, just want to thanks Marvel, Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo for this amazing 11 years, Avengers is not just a movie for us, its an emotion, i grew up watching this. Endgame worth every penny ,every seconds , just bring tissue paper ,you will definitely cry. LOVE YOU 3000 TIMES!!!"
1380,"Apr 26, 2019",10,An emotional roller coaster from start to finish. You can't find a better ending to the Avengers saga.DON'T MISS IT
1381,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"I'm honestly surprised at the amount of highly rated reviews, this feels like the standard superhero movie with a few little twists. The characters are standard and fine, with the exception of Captain Marvel, who is so perfect that she only fails when the plot tells her to and she has no stake or motivation in the story. The plot is slow, obvious, and kind-of bad honestly, but the action is good, especially the final action scene. It's a fine movie, I like it more than Avengers 2, Thor 1-2, etc. But it's not life changing in any way. Bonus points to Hawkeye for actually being a somewhat good character. 6.5/10"
1382,"May 4, 2019",10,This movie is an amazing way of seeing all the heroes in action.
1383,"May 2, 2019",1,"First, half of ""universe"" died and the rest can't go on, all heroes was crying without a life sense. Can't believe that. A child on a bicycle angry ¿for what? He was too young to loose the faith. The humanity always rise after a war, even if they lost the war, Germany, URSS, Jews, Spain, Japan. Terrible film message.Second, all the effort to bring out the Captain Marvel before the endgame and with the hope in her to solve the Thanos issue. For nothing, Captain Marvel do nothing... all expectations for nothing.Action only until the end, the rest of the movie was boring.Thank god Marvel is over, no need to know nothing about Marvel Universe. It was almost a bad addiction finally cure."
1384,"Feb 24, 2020",10,"I had been out of the loop over Marvel movies for too long until I watched this movie, then I decided to watch all the previous ones. I have yet to pull that off, but nonetheless I wanted to go back and watch this epic conclusion again with the benefit of hindsight and it never ceases to be so awe-inspiring.The other movie I watched a second time was ""Interstellar,"" by the way.This time I'm scaling the rating up from 8 to 10.Looking back you can't help marveling at the unrivaled labors of 12 years and 22 movies from Marvel Studios. They really did create a wonderful world of their own.And to remember how naive Robert Downey, Jr. looked in the first ""Iron Man"" in retrospect, compared to where he wound up in ""Avengers: Endgame"" - the giant on whose shoulders everyone else in this Marvel Universe stands - that is something that could not be said even of ""Star Wars.""Happy trails."
1385,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Awesome movie.. a special treat to the marvel fans by the Russo bros. really liked the movie, a must watch movie for every marvel fan out there. Its really the ENDGAME, a nice and sad ending of the infinity saga."
1386,"Nov 12, 2021",9,I'm a dc fan but i love the hell out of it ! The movie was slow but wasn't boring at all and i enjoyed every second of it. One of the best in the MCU.
1387,"May 5, 2019",10,"After watching this twice, I understood the story of Avengers: Endgame. The Avengers failed after the Infinity War. Never in their lifetime faced an incredible and inevitable enemy like Thanos. Josh Brolin delivers a badass Thanos. He is smart, he did the unthinkable, and he made it tough for our heroes to restore the loss. Whatever it takes was the Avengers motivation. Huge sacrifices must be taken. Seeing the Avengers rise from hopelessness and failure is the most amazing feeling in this movie. The huge price was delivered and this movie hands down is the best movie of 2019. The final battle makes it epic.The Russo Brothers deliver a phenomenal film. I give them high praise for their direction and work to make this film the best. The actors and actresses are amazing, 22 movies in 10 years. All influenced into one movie. I love 3000."
1388,"May 6, 2019",10,"I have watch this movie and really it is really the ""ENDGAME"" movie for all marvel movie since iron man in 2008. Wow, cant imagine thats already has been 11 years from that first MCU movie. Last word, FANTASTIC :)"
1389,"Apr 27, 2019",10,I am speechless after watching this movie. Still having problem processing my thoughts after watching this movie. Some big changes were made and it will be very unacceptable to many hardcore MCU fans but everything must come to an end. The best ending to a decade of movie journey and end to an epic saga. Kudos to Russo brothers for gifting viewers this epic conclusion.
1390,"Apr 28, 2019",10,One of the best Sci fi movie of all time.. end of an Era for great Tony Stark.
1391,"Apr 30, 2019",7,"As the conclusion of the current MCU, it does a great job. Everything ties together well. Wouldn't be surprised if they had this whole movie script all but finalized 10 years ago. Even opened a few new possibilities of future story lines. Mildly disappointed with how Captain Marvel was utilised.Aside from the MCU stuff; as an actual movie, I had far too many problems with it. From certain fight sequences, to one dimensional characters, to forced diversity, to pacing issues.TL;DR Great MCU conclusion, decent movie"
1392,"Mar 26, 2021",3,"La película es bastante entretenida, muestra lo que dice que mostrará y como dice que lo hará pero no avanza de eso, siempre se muestra como una película totalmente fans service y para culminar esa era está bien pero siento deberían hacer algo menos para fans y hacerla como el fin de su era."
1393,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I have no words to describe the feeling about this way to end the journey
1394,"Jul 12, 2020",9,"Writing, effects and acting is brilliant in this movie.Before watching this film, make sure you've watched all other marvel films in revolving around the characters, or prepare to have much go over your head."
1395,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"This is the real movie ! The real marvel ! The real avengers ! This is the real meaning of sacrifice ! Everything in this movie gives you the feeling that you have to do something and you should do this. If you don't , everything will be destroyed ! You know if you wanna win this game you need to end it ; but with your real hero that sleep inside you for long time.We are in the End game now ..."
1396,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Had to make an account to write this, but yes this is worth a 10. Mainly on the hype train to keep this brilliant film as highly rated as possible."
1397,"Oct 26, 2019",10,"Honestly, this is probably the best superhero film I've ever seen in my life. Not only does this film deliver on spectacle, but it's very character driven as well, especially in the first act. Not many superhero films can deal with grief and lost in such a great way, and then can make you laugh in the next scene without feeling jarring. I don't see how Marvel Studios can top this film."
1398,"Apr 28, 2019",10,The Best Movie Of All Time So Far Because It Has All The Things To Entertain You. Every Thing Was Good In The Movie. The Russo Brothers Have Done A Superb Job. And At Last Love RDJ. U R My Idol.
1399,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"Not a bad movie Could be better. Graphics were great 👏 The thor character was not good at the story We were more excited than the story This movie has put a lot of questions?! In the end, thank you to the friends who make the movies relevant to the viewer.💙"
1400,"Dec 7, 2020",1,"Constant stupid jokes, annoying cgi, fake deaths, predictable outcomes, product placement, no sense of danger, self indulgent ending, idiotic fan service, brainless action, and cliche-ridden idiocy is the best way to describe this film. It is fast food for the brain. If you want to take your kids to a fun movie, skip endgame, take them to Ford vs Ferrari. It may be just as sad at times, but it is based off a true story and has great acting, intelligent humor, a fantastic script, and heartwarming moments. It is enjoyable for everyone, and it doesn't have to be as idiotic as this trash to get people to enjoy it. Scorsese is right."
1401,"May 4, 2019",10,"Its an end of a era,If you have been watching these Movies since Iron man you have to watch this"
1402,"Apr 26, 2019",10,It was amazing!! It's really hard to find a mistake with this movie because everything from the plot to the dialogue was amazing.
1403,"May 1, 2019",10,Loved the integration of all the heroes and the way it ended
1404,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Avengers - Endgame offers a stunning and moving ending. The best I could've expected. Many people cried... Thank you Marvel for this experience, I don't know If it'll ever happen again."
1405,"Nov 13, 2019",10,Best movie ever I have seen and will suggest it to everyone
1406,"May 4, 2019",10,"This is an edit on my first review where I talked about how I loved it more on my second viewing than my first, but over time I now think more about how my Dad took me to see the star wars movies and the Indiana Jones movies and how that was my childhood. I took my kids and I hope that when they grow up the avengers theme is what the star wars theme was for me!My Dad has passed away and my regret is I couldn't show him what he showed me.I can take heart though knowing that I've now replaced my Dad in the scenario and hopefully passing on the same memories with my kids.Take your Dad man, you'll be forever grateful."
1407,"Apr 29, 2019",6,Think that summarises it. Look the plot has the odd nice twist and some of the jokes hit home but honestly three hours with this sort of pacing is a struggle. Think I'd have preferred to watch it at home.
1408,"May 6, 2019",1,"Time paradoxes are glossed over, bad story writing, completely wasted my time"
1409,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"You probably heard people reviewing comic book movies with the line 'this scene is ripped straight out of the comic book page' and with endgame it couldn't be more true. i mean the story is touching, the battle is EPIC, and the jokes are funny. and i promise you there are SO MANY SURPRISES in this movie and they're all GREAT! i have some crazy hope and really high expectation and marvel exceeded all of them. you wont feel that its 3 hour long movie because its just so good! thank god i already had another ticket on sunday. the only critics i'd give is that i came 5 minute late :("
1410,"May 6, 2019",10,The film does a great job of connecting to all the Marvel movies from the past. The 3 hr run times seemed to fly past.
1411,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Never has a sequel or franchise been so complete. Perfect writing, perfect effects, perfect stunts. So many call backs with payoffs. There were grown men and women weeping. And all your wishes and expectations have come through."
1412,"Oct 4, 2019",9,It's well directed. It's well edited. Great use of chi and it also gives a emotional punch along the way of this roller coaster ride of a movie
1413,"May 1, 2019",10,"Little long but is pretty cool, all the super hero's were cool but not exactly sure where vision was?!?"
1414,"May 1, 2019",7,"Took a while to process my thoughts and gather words. Still haven't recovered from the existential crisis this film caused because I don't feel like wanting anything anymore because I feel like it gave me everything I needed. Nothing feels exciting anymore maybe because I won't be anticipating anything as much as I anticipated this for a very long time. So I am just sitting here questioning life, hope I snap out of it soon (no pun intended)When a film is a culmination of 21 films and about 11 years of hard work, it becomes immune to criticism because then it's more than just a film. This is just an attempt to put my thoughts down in words, show gratitude and say goodbye.Endgame subverted expectations and got everything it needed to address from the ending of Infinity War right out of the way to kick off the actual story of this movie, which made it quite unpredictable because there was still over two hours left.Since spoilers aren't allowed, I would say the underlying logic behind certain science fiction elements this film involves might be questionable to some degree but the way they handled it by embracing the light hearted side of MCU and cleverly poked fun at it in hilarious ways which somehow worked, you had no option but to go along anyway especially once the tension filled second act goes into some crazy unexpected directions that kept me on the edge of my seat.Some may argue the first half is slow or that it's not as inventive as some of the previous great MCU films but they were in a corner after what happened at the end of Infinity War which was nothing short of perfect. This film had to follow through on that and it delivered and that's all I needed.It also somehow managed to pay tribute to all three first phases and almost every single important character without compromising the story and by weaving all the homages and references brilliantly in exactly the right places. It provided closure to everything they have been setting up slowly over the years and I tip my hat to Marvel Studios for being able to pull that off.The entire last act of this movie is just COMIC BOOK MOVIE HISTORY and MOVIE HISTORY. I COULD NOT BELIEVING WHAT I WAS WITNESSING. That's all I can say to describe how absolutely insane and balls to the walls crazy it was. I can't come up with words for the things this movie and this universe made feel throughout the years. I honestly feel like my life's over, like I've gotten everything I ever wanted.And for that, Thank you Kevin Feige, Thank you to the trinity of MCU - Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr who brought their characters to life and a standing ovation to Russo Brothers who not only made such a massive event work but exceeded my expectations regarding what MCU could be. This universe is an achievement that will go down as one of the most influential achievements in film history.To everyone involved with the MCU, Love you all 3000. I don't think I'll ever be able to thank everyone involved for how much they have influenced my life and those who will continue to do so going forward. And I can never be too grateful to the man himself, Stan Lee. Excelsior.I can't rate this because no matter what rating I give, some will say I'm overrating while some will say I'm underrating it. Though I may add a placeholder rating for IMDB.I hate to say goodbye to this era of MCU but this is goodbye. I honestly can't believe it's been more than 11 years since I first watched RDJ suiting up as Iron Man in the first MCU film. I used to watch that film in wonder and amazement and now we are here with such a massive universe with these iconic characters. MCU will go on but man, I'll miss everything about this era of MCU. Farewell (for now)"
1415,"Apr 28, 2019",8,"Movie has a little bit too much comedy. I wish it kept the dark and serious tone throughout the film. Anyways, don't go in expecting a lot of action though. Doesn't really have action until the final 45 minutes. Movie is a mix of Inception, Back to the Future, and Infinity War.It is a little bit too long though, and the first 40+ minutes were pretty slow. 8/10"
1416,"May 6, 2019",1,Meh...could have made better use of the superheroes
1417,"Apr 25, 2019",10,Everything you expect but that 10 times. Throwbacks to previous movies. A movie for the real fans!!
1418,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Having watched the entire MCU in chronological order, this made the effort all worth while. What a way to end an era."
1419,"May 5, 2019",10,"Not only the best marvel film, the best overall film I've ever seen."
1420,"Jul 17, 2019",8,The movie is fine but is very overrated. The first 2 hours are so slow and boring to be honest. This movie only amazed marvel fan's. The 8 out of 10 is more than deserved.
1421,"May 5, 2019",10,A great conclusion to the avengers movies. One of marvels best
1422,"Mar 8, 2020",10,The end of pretty great era and different end from most of marvel films ( marvel is a marvelous ) .
1423,"Jun 1, 2020",10,"Look if you are not a fan of marvel or the avengers then this movie will give a small satisfaction but if you are a marvel fan you are the passengers of this journey (2008-2019) then this movie will give you happiness,sadness,a lot of comedy and much more."
1424,"Aug 8, 2022",6,"I'm not a big fan of superhero films.. I've enjoyed a few but I'm no fanboy. Seeing men in tights with big letters on their chests just doesn't do it for me. But I do like Batman Begins as an example of some guy in tights still been a good film.. I like gritty and a little dark my super heros. I liked some of the X-Men franchise. (I,II, Future Past..) These were sometimes intelligent and interesting. Sadly to me the whole Avengers franchise has felt like a dumbed down version of the X-Men films.. It's basically a lot of ego centric stereotypes wise cracking at each other and showing off. Sadly that's what I got from watching this. The first hour was terrible. Spoilers potentially! It gets better in the second half for a while. The actors show some emotion! Wow.. some years are shed. The wooden acting still shines through however.. I mean I'm surprised at the high ratings for this film. It seems like everyone a just forgiven the huge plot holes, poor acting and unnatural script writing and ultra predictable stereotypes .. and everything that's bland and wrong with this film... Because... It cost a boat load of money? Has a lot of secrecy around the ending(s)? I actually stopped watching with about 30 mins left.. after the big battle where everyone is thrown together to fight off this guy who by that time we don't even care what happens to him anymore anyway.. it's all just a big mess if you ask me. I really don't get it. So many plot holes and WTF moments? It's just all so wooden.. Like Guardians of the Galaxy but less funny, fun or relatable. The CGI was disappointing. The hulk character had no life in him.. and neither did the actors sadly. Half of the planets population is wiped out by."
1425,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Not every highly-anticipated movie lives up to the expectations but Avengers: Endgame is one of those few that delivered almost everything that's been promised or to some extent, even more. Not only this is the perfect follow up to INFINITY WAR (2018) but a remarkably done, moving homage to a 10 year long successful franchise consisting 21 films!While the first hour & so skillfully sets up the high-stakes, gradually reveals the remaining avengers in an utterly emotionally wounded & frustrated post Infinity War world, the film cleverly picks up the momentum right after that with lots of twists & turns backed up by little & big moments of excitements as well as tears of joy & heart-pounding loss at the end.Kudos to the director-duo Russo brothers, the writers and everyone involved with this absolute epic conclusion of the saga that ultimately pulled off the most satisfying ending this whole story arc could have.Can't figure at the moment how they or anyone will be able to top this one in coming years."
1426,"Mar 5, 2020",9,"This movie marks the end of an era and it's one of those you remember forever, this was the first time I've cried in the cinema and I got a lot of chills watching this, the movie is greatly done with amazing special effects. That ending is sad and beautiful at the same time, hands down the best Avengers movie!"
1427,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"My undying passion for films (and other media) always lingered since I was a baby. That being said, my passion for this craft exploded when I saw the Earth's Mightiest Heroe's team up in 2012. Marvel Studios had something special on their hands with The Avengers, then Cap: TWS, then Guardians of the Galaxy, then Civil War.... and so on. They almost always one-upped themselves in terms of quality as each subsequent movie came out. The journey that we experience with these Heroe's is so very special, and I'm grateful for it. I always love visiting these stories every time they put out a film. (Trying my best not to sound preachy here haha!) I know some of this may sound silly, but these heroes have always been important to me. Marvel studios have always delivered (at least for me). They released my favourite film of all time - Infinity War, last year and I really didn't think they had it in them to top it. Lo and Behold, Endgame was perfect. It resonated with me on so many levels. I'm not going to go into specifics, because I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone, but these are the reasons why I absolutely, wholeheartedly love Avengers Endgame: As comics coming to life - there were scenes that EXPLODED my mind. I cheered my lungs out opening night. As a deep dive into characters - I felt the repercussions of the previous event that took place, I love the way they handled ""loss"". I was emotionally taken by the well-written script as well as the acting that carried the perfect slow-pace of the first half of the movie. The characters dealing with the snap in their own ways was executed so well. Connected with them on a whole other level. Loved the pacing of the film. I also love how each character has grown; If you go back to the early movies and then you watch endgame... Our beloved Heroes are fundamentally the same, with we'll set morals, though they've grown for the better over the years and continue to do so in this one. Growth of astoundingly well-made characters you care about should be commended. As for the laughs - there were so many of them, such great ones that landed 95% of the time. Well written comedy that I ate up. I think the comedy this time around was sprinkled in at better moments, that never broke the seriousness of a scene (when compared to something like Guardians 2...). A lot of fun laughs to be had ay! As of the action - FREAKING PHENOMENAL. I Screamed, I Cheered, I Clapped. I tend not to burst out with the above in theatres, but I couldn't hold myself back... Trust me, I tried. So well done. The entire third act is something to behold. As for the music - Alan Silvestri, take a bow. The Avengers theme is so iconic now, thank you for giving that to us. Thank you for using it so well in this film and thank you for creating new tracks that I know I'm going to listen to on repeat. The soundtrack was seamlessly awesome in this film! As for the directing & acting - The Russo Brothers... Alright, I'm not going to say anything more than I have before. You guys are the best, really, how y'all handle these mammoth tasks with perfection is beyond me. The two of you are crazy amazing. The actors brought their A game as always too. The movie focused on the core 6 avengers with a few exceptions here and there. RDJ & Evans took my breath away once again, but PAUL RUDD is a huge standout to me coming out of this. The way he handles his lovable Ruddness brand of humour with so much emotional depth in this film is brilliant. Scar Jo, Renner, Ruffalo, Hemsworth... You guys. I loved all of them, I don't want to pick out any favourites because they all played their roles to beyond perfection. As for the heart - Endgame, after one viewing has become my favourite movie of all time. This movie strung together a fresh, cool, heavy, yet satisfying plot with such care. Characters and Heart make or break a film for me, and Endgame is a prime example of how well the two are executed. I was emotionally drained at the end of the movie. I screamed my lungs off, I laughed my butt off and my lord, I uncontrollably cried my eyes out... Yet by the end of it all, I walked out with the biggest smile on my face. Thank you for this gift Marvel Studios.A thing isn't beautiful because it lasts."
1428,"May 6, 2019",10,It's the best movie ever made but only if you have see the other 22 movies that are before this.
1429,"Apr 28, 2019",10,I've never done this before but the movie is so great I was willing to vote.
1430,"May 24, 2020",7,Good movie but lacks script writing. It lacks content.
1431,"Apr 27, 2019",8,"There will be a lot of people gushing on here about this movie. Make no mistake, it was good, just not great. 21 films leading up to this point have built the tension, and what should have been a sonic boom was closer to a car backfiring. At three hours, this is a long movie. While there are moments of great humor and great sadness and great happiness, it also dragged in spots. One would expect it to be 95% action, but they spent a lot of time on fluff. Again, do not misunderstand me. I liked this movie quite a bit, but I wanted to love it, and sadly I didn't."
1432,"Feb 20, 2020",7,"I should say , Avengers Endgame could have been far better and way more incredible if around 20-30 minutes were trimmed off from the runtime that includes the first half scenes . 181 minutes is too much time and it is disappointing to see that half of this film is not worth it . A binding of 22 films and ending is satisfying and the best ever but , for the movie as a whole 8.5 IMDB (as per now) is over rated and the credit goes to MCU fans who got swayed with just last 40 minutes of the film for which I think they came . This movie was not better tham Avengers Infinity War ."
1433,"May 7, 2019",1,"This movie was a waste of time. I went to see this movie expecting something epic... more epic than Infinity War but was grossly disappointed. Movie was too slow, no action, much drama. I thought this was a comic movie? I wish I could give this movie 0/10."
1434,"May 4, 2019",9,"(Non spoiler review) I really love how this film starts slow and ends really fast. It is a epic end to a amazing series created by marvel,I love how emotional how the superheros seem to be after knowing how infinity war ended. I hope everyone goes to see this film it is a awesome watch and the charcters and action make this a worth while end to the franchise!"
1435,"May 28, 2020",10,A great sum up to all of the 23 movies. It has everything that anyone would want to watch. The 3 hour runtime is totally worth it.
1436,"Apr 25, 2019",10,There should be 2 movies so much story.. i want to see it again
1437,"May 5, 2019",10,10/10. Fully lives up to the hype. Totally recommended.
1438,"May 26, 2019",10,Very very good movie Thank you Rose brothers for create this movie
1439,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"A masterclass to culminate 21 movies. If you are a fan of the MCU, appreciate all it has to offer, and are open to what comes around the corner, then this movie delivers on all front. Multiple viewings necessary in order to fully grasp to shear monstrosity that is a Endgame. You will laugh, cheer, shake with adrenaline, and cry. Thank you Marvel and the Russo brothers, this was fun."
1440,"Apr 28, 2019",7,"It's a pretty good movie and provides a good bookend to the saga. Endgame succeeds in what it tries to do in the superhero genre and deserves a high rating in that respect. Conversely, in a holistic context it's not one of the greatest movies of all time as the overall rating suggests."
1441,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Definitive ending to the characters and full packed joyride to the thrilling end , BTW the last 45 minutes are better than any film"
1442,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This has to be the greatest movie of all time, never ever have I seen a film as phenomenal as this, in every department."
1443,"Sep 24, 2019",8,"I was shocked, I seriously expected the worst for this movie and even held off watching it for ages after it came out because people just said it was so poorly done but in reality it was quite spectacular, for me anyway. I'm content with how this movie went and ended."
1444,"Aug 8, 2019",10,"Im happy to see finale like that , goodbye Avengers ;("
1445,"Aug 2, 2019",10,"Most electrifying scenes of all time, most emotional scenes of all time, greatest action, hardest goodbyes, comedy, tear rolling big six credits... and so much more. I just wish the writers gave Iron man and Thor their own great moments to shine during the fight with thanos."
1446,"Aug 6, 2019",10,"I can't say more than that I have enjoyed every single second! People and even some critics can't stop complaining about the length of this movie, which doesn't line up to the fact that this is the end (together with far from home) of an era containing 22 movies! What else is there to say? Well, I didn't have such a great time in cinema for a year, the last one was Infinity War;) To come to an end: Every emotion was affected by this movie, literally EVERY emotion! From joy to anger, over to fear, ending in sadness...This is one of the best movies in the past 7 years! So if you haven't seen it yet: Go ahead!!!"
1447,"Sep 10, 2019",6,"You remember, when kids, how cool it was when Bruce Banner got mad and became hulk without control? How cool the old spiderman movies were (tobey mcguire as actor)? Superhero movies have become franchising for kids, making them more funny than how they were before and they just feel different. I can really see that they are targeting little kids. These movies are NOT anymore for older people too.This movie was most of the time trying to be funny, sometime being, but the superhero part was just not feeling like it made me feel years ago (even the first avenger movie was cool). That feeling of ""Omg, wow, this gavee me goosebumps"" is gone with Marvel's movies. Hulk that became rational and not anymore the violent Irrational beast? Thor fat and drunk? Other characters just boring. Superheroes movies don't feel like it anymore. They are cute for little kids but I felt really stupid watching it as a 25 years old."
1448,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"Robert Downey Jr.'s gaunt Tony Stark records his message to his beloved Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, aboard the disabled spaceship last seen in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", ""Part of the journey is the end..."" After 11 years of Marvel movies, Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo's ""Avengers: Endgame"" signifies the end of the journey with laughter and surprising poignancy. At one point holdout Avengers leader Natasha (former assassin Black Widow), played by beautiful soulful Scarlett Johansson, refers to the Avengers as ""family"". That resonates for us, too. For the last 11 years these screen Heroes have become family. We care what becomes of them. Do they find peace? Do they discover love?""Endgame"" screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely patiently crescendo to the showdown with seemingly omnipotent galactic villain Thanos, motion captured by malevolently measured Josh Brolin, whom defeated the Avengers, by wiping out half of all life in the universe using the Infinity Gauntlet possessing all 6 Infinity Stones. The climactic battle is visually astounding, and oh so costly. Yet, what inspires most about ""Endgame"" is family and heart.Most of ""Endgame"" takes place 5 years after Titan's Warrior Thanos decimated half the population of the universe, including about half of the Avengers. Here less is actually more. Where as in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", way too many Superheroes resulted in the kluged narrative, focusing on the surviving Heroes: Chris Evans's Captain America (Steve Rogers), Robert's Iron Man, and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, displaced God of Thunder, empowers the story. Brie Larson's all-powerful Captain Marvel charismatically emerges as the new Avenger. Too bad the Russo's couldn't leverage more for Brie. Then again, that might have been narrative saturation.Where ""Infinity War"" was so dour and so self-absorbed, ""Endgame"" has a wicked sense of humor. Mark Ruffalo's glasses wearing civilized green giant Hulk taking selfies with adoring teen fans is hysterical. Critical to restoring their fallen Heroes in Thanos's aftermath, the surviving Avengers utilize time travel in hopes of preventing Thanos from possessing all Infinity Stones. In the hilarious expository exchange regarding the effects of changing past and future events: ""This is not 'Back to the Future'."" No, it's not. And I busted out laughing.The human narrative touches in ""Endgame"". The distinct strength of the Marvel Universe Movies are its Actors. Travelling back to 1970, Robert's Tony Stark meets his estranged Father Howard, the genius engineer, played by earnest John Slattery. Howard has no idea that he's talking to his future son, because his wife is about to give birth. Robert's authentic compassion moves. Tony hugs Howard, who expressed doubt about being a good Father, saying, ""It'll work out."" Then you realize that was the only time the two had ever hugged. On that same trip back, Chris Evans's Steve wistfully gazes at Peggy Carter, played by captivating Hayley Atwell. Peggy is the forsaken love of Cap's life.Chris Hemsworth's Thor travels back to the Norse legendary Asgard to retrieve an Infinity Stone. He encounters his mortal Mother Frigga, the powerful sorceress played by beautiful strong Rene Russo, on the day she's to die. In a subdued joke, rotund Thor has seen better days, since failing to dispatch Thanos in ""Infinity War"". His loving Mom tells her son that she knows that he's suffered. Looking into his eyes Frigga says, ""The measure of the Hero is being true to yourself."" Amen.Really, ""Endgame"" is awesome, because of heart. In that Karen Gillan is understated power as the mostly machine Nebula, daughter of Thanos. Her Father had contested her against sister Gamora, played by brilliantly strong Zoe Saldana, for his love. Tortured and devalued Nebula, becomes ravaged with vengeance upon her Father. Yet, Karen makes us believe that Nebula's soul is worth salvation.Yeah, at 3 hours and 1 minutes ""Endgame"" is the restroom challenge. I kid, well sort of. Despite all that, I loved ""Avengers: Endgame"". It's the poignant, whimsical end of the journey. At least for me, the Avengers are my fictional Hero family. Like the characters on the wide screen, we all experience suffering, profound loss, joy, and triumph. In life, like Chris's Cap says, ""Take your baby steps... Move forward."" I for one shall remember the Avengers in my heart."
1449,"May 13, 2019",1,"This is by far the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. Ever.I was looking forward to it after last year's Infinity War, to see how they would bounce back from that Thanos snap. But boy, was I disappointed. The whole ""time heist"" plot is tortuously senseless, it lacks any form of intelligence from any aspect, be it scientific or imaginative. What kind of ""writers"" are responsible for this? Or what were they on while ""writing"" this? The quick one-liners, barbs and quips are cringe-worthy and so are the ""comedic"" situations.One can objectively agree that the movie is way too long and boring for the first two hours, even my 11 yo super-fan brother thought so. It offers very little entertainment. The plot is too incoherent for any sensible adults and very complex to follow for the young ones so they just eagerly await the battle finale. Which does arrive at the end in the form of a badly choreographed CGI bukake scene with pyrotechnics and many, many cuts for anyone to follow what the heck is going on.Massive, glaring plot-holes abound from start to finish which I bet are invisible to the throngs of fanboys all over the world over-hyping and claiming this piece of hot, leaky garbage to be the greatest movie ever made. Along with giving it over the top reviews and ratings.Can't believe this is what sells to the masses and makes studios billions of dollars now. Makes me lose all hope in future superhero movies. I couldn't wait for it to get over and go home. A complete waste of time."
1450,"Jul 31, 2019",10,I just want to say how amazing this film is from start to finish. This will take you on a emotional ride.You will not he disappointed
1451,"Jun 12, 2019",10,Many of the 1/10 reviews or people that say infinity war is better is the people who don't understand most of what is happening or haven't seen all of the marvel films or have not read any marvel comics. Endgame is a true treat for hardcore fans such as I am as I have seen every marvel movie and have read many of the comics. It is full of satisfying scenes that have references to other marvel movies so the people that say endgame is a waste of time don't understand the references to older movies. Endgame is one of those movies where you really have to watch previous movies to find it fun. If you have not seen all or most of the marvel movies or have not read any comics you will feel bored and confused of the plot as most of the movie is fan service to marvel fans which is a 3 hour special with all characters from every marvel movie which will satisfy true marvel fans.
1452,"Mar 27, 2021",10,What is wrong with people.they are rating 1 or 2. I mean this is the greatest movie of marvel. Those who are rating 1 on this movie are probably hater or they don't have better taste on movies.
1453,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"The title says it all. Just a suggestion, don't spoil it for yourself"
1454,"May 8, 2019",7,"This movie was actually good and enjoyable, i could say this movie has plot holes as and the middle part of the movie was pretty boring, mostly because the middle part didn't feel like avengers, but i gotta say that the beginning and and the ending was the best parts, i could watch this movie as many times i want, but to compare this to infinity war, infinity war wins in my opinion, because this one starts slow, i do recommend this but it had some flaws"
1455,"Aug 8, 2019",10,This is everything I needed from Endgame.a Lot of people who only watched it for the hype won't be able to enjoy the movie as much as we Marvel do. It gave the characters the ending they deserved and oh my God that last fight scene is a freaking masterpiece. I don't think any movie will ever make me feel the way I felt while watching Endgame in a decade.
1456,"Jun 20, 2019",7,"There are so many 10/10 ratings on here for this film but frankly it's not that good, the hype was better than the film. Yes it had great moments and I'm not saying it's a bad film because it's not. But it's not the best film the MCU have ever made."
1457,"May 21, 2019",4,1st hour and a half in I was ready for it toend so long and dragged out the last 30-45 mins made for good watching but that's it
1458,"Aug 6, 2019",10,"I'm assuming the low ratings are by comic book nerds. This movie was amazing. A laughed out loud, by myself, many times and cried a lot. I'm really surprised by how much considering this is just a block buster super hero movie. The thing is, I actually like movies. And I know they are entertainment. Are there holes in the time travel plot? Sure, but who cares. Just use your imagination to fill in the holes. Or don't think about it too much. It's not real life folks. I'm just grateful I live in the exact period of time where movies like this are possible. It's amazing what they can do. Imagine someone from the 1920's or 1820's saw this? Be grateful. This movie was a masterpiece. If you want less plot holes, watch a film, or read a book. This is a movie. And a damn good one."
1459,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"OMG! ""Avengers: Endgame"" is absolutely Action Packed, Amazing, Epic, Brilliant, Masterpiece, and it's way more fun and better than Infinity War, like every Audience and I thought it would be. It had all the action, humor, and had very emotional scenes. The Russo Brothers, did way better than Joss Whedon. Why? Because, it's ""A must see"" and a perfect Marvel Studios film, for the whole entire audience to watch, but I Can't tell you what happens, or what happens in the end or who's coming back to life, because in the end of ""Avengers: Endgame"", no one, and I mean no one, or anyone, can guess what's gonna happen :) And Now it's shattering Box Office Records around the World! :) I loved it 3000 :) and it's far better than the first Avengers movie, and Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Avengers: Infinity War.Thank you, Marvel, Kevin Feige, The Russo Brothers, and most of all, Thank you, Stan Lee."
1460,"Oct 2, 2021",10,"Best movie ever created even . Storyline was awesome and animation was spectacular. I think the rock-heart inhumans are disliking this movie and mr/ms hate I know your life can just spread hate so it's ok some inhumans are in the world. It's also the 2 most earned movie of over 2 billion dollars so they have earned what they wanted and gained love from all mcu and rest . So , joke on you mr/ms hate."
1461,"Apr 29, 2019",9,"First off, I'll just say that you should put aside any fears that its three-hour run-time might be down to a lack of pace, for 'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' moves exactly as it needs to and it really does fly by. It's not too fast-paced, though, as it takes the time to make sure its events have an impact, which is greatly appreciated. The story, which is shrouded in secrecy and - on my part - shall remain so, is actually quite bold. It never feels like it's under any pressure to move in a specific direction, constantly evolving in natural and, even, somewhat surprising ways. It may take a few small leaps in logic, and generally require a bit more suspension of disbelief than is usual with this sort of stuff, but it never breaks its own rules. Every decision the filmmakers make is for the benefit of the narrative, even those which gloss over - and, thus, retrospectively highlight - some of its (admittedly fastidious) unanswered questions. None of these possible, and only very slight, 'plot holes' even matter, though, primarily because the affair is so much fun. It also takes a lot of risks, being as far away from 'cookie-cutter' as it can. While it may lean towards some elements that long-time fans of the overall franchise might have seen coming, it always presents things in fairly unique, unexpected ways and consistently puts importance on character above all else. This is, as usual, what really makes the feature work. Even when things are at their biggest (and, trust me, they get big), you're never far from a smaller, often more satisfying character-revealing moment. The major characters here are more well-rounded than in 'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)', despite the fact that there's almost as many. This includes, thankfully, Captain America himself, who was somewhat sidelined last time; in fact, he's perhaps the main player this time, alongside Iron Man. Some characterisations are also unanticipated and will almost certainly be polarising, but they're certainly appreciated - even if only for the risk. The antagonist is a little weaker this time as he's a bit more traditionally 'bad guy', but he's built on a more-than-solid foundation and is as imposing as ever. Marvel have made no qualms in calling this the end of an era - the so-called 'infinity saga', to be more specific - and it really does feel like a culmination of this (over) ten-year journey, especially in terms of the 'main' Avengers. It's certainly a film for the fans and it isn't squeamish about it. It's incredibly satisfying, to say the least. It's also incredibly moving in a number of key scenes. You'll experience pretty much every emotion a movie can give you. The whole thing is slightly strange, helped immensely by knowing very little before going in. It's almost difficult to describe, in a way, but its effect is actually quite profound. I suppose it takes a while to 'come to terms' with. I don't think I've fully formed my opinion on it just yet. Don't get me wrong, though. It's great. It's more than great. It's a new kind of cinematic event, the kind of story only possible with a twenty-one movie backlog of character histories and audience investment. The more I think about it, the more I like it. The visuals are stunning, the CG is seamless, the action is spectacular, the characters are superb, the scale is staggering, the scope is substantial, the stakes are serious and the story is simply splendid. It really is something. 9/10"
1462,"Sep 28, 2021",9,"Characters I hate captain marvel such a lame character she is sepose to be the strongest,c'mon,what a load of bullp*ss.The rest of the characters was awesome especially Tony Stark aka iron man he stole the show as usual and of course Thor and so on...Story The ending made me cry😭😭 so yeah that's all.Comedy Only few jokes landed especially Thor's but most of em was lame.The bad thing about this movie was that after I watched it a few times it got so boring and I only watched it three times. The story made less sense and the jokes just got so more bad. This is definitely not the best avengers movie just because it's the last one doesn't make it the best.Yeah so that is my review. Great on your first watch but bad after your second or third."
1463,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Didn't think they would beat Infinity War but man they did. By far THE GREATEST MARVEL FILM EVER MADE.
1464,"Apr 29, 2019",6,"Infinity loop. Now back to the past. Its the same. Too much emotional. Too much patriarcal. The women are atrezzo, they only stay in a second plane. Captain Marvel just talk two times. WTF! Disappointing. Meh."
1465,"Jun 27, 2019",4,"Sorry, I didn't like it. Too long, too nostalgic, too self congratulatory, too much..Given it was better than Avengers Ultron but not by much."
1466,"Oct 3, 2021",10,This best film to watch having high rating and box office being the highest grossing film. I watched it hall it was so nice.
1467,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I love the ending very much! And I cried so many time. It's so good to live in these Marvel's years! I am going to watch this masterpiece one more time, maybe third, fourth......Times! Thanks Marvel Thanks Stan Lee Thanks Russo Bro. Thanks Avengers! #Nospoiler #Respect"
1468,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This was nearly perfect. Trust me. It is the best film the MCU has to offer so far. As a fan of the franchise for nearly a decade (around two-thirds of my life, I am 12), it really left me satisfied with the conclusion of the stories I've been following for most of my life. I still remember my obsession with Iron Man 2 and Captain America: The First Avenger (primarily the latter) when they first came out when I was very young.All the storylines I've been following for the better part of my entire life so far getting wrapped up (for the most part) really put a smile on my face. Infinity War was one of my favorite movies when it came out. I was mesmerized by the amount of material packed into those two and a half hours of runtime, but Endgame put all that to shame. The three hours of runtime gave the movie a lot of leeway with the plot, and it put all that to good use. It almost felt like two or three movies packed into one.It does have a few flaws, however (although not severe enough to remove a star). A lot of different things were happening at once, leaving me somewhat discombobulated, although not too much. I won't dock any stars because of this, however, as the ending more than made up for it and some of my discombobulation may be accredited to the loud (yet admittedly fun) theater (as me and my friends were watching the first screening in the whole city).Overall, I'd say this is a ten from me. You'd be doing yourself a favor if you watch this, even if you haven't watched any of the prior movies (even more so if you have watched even only just a few of them)."
1469,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"I was pessimistic and fatigued with Marvel in the past few years, but Endgame is the most enjoyable movie since the original standalone films way back when the MCU was first being set up. Where Infinity War was lacking in terms of tension, Endgame picks up the slack, with tightly bound scenes and interesting twists and turns. Characters act in logical ways and it is simply a joy experiencing and sharing in their time on screen. This was a far more fulfilling experience than I expected and I was really won over by the fantastic acting and the meticulous attention to detail in every scene."
1470,"Aug 25, 2019",10,No spoilers except expect to cry at some point. Can't believe this phase is over. I love these movies.
1471,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"A brilliant ending to the Avengers series. It doesn't top Infinity War which is simply in a league of it's own, but it does do it justice. It's a slower pace than Infinity War, but the build up is worth it.I knocked off a few stars for what they did with Hulk and Thor, who were two of my favourite characters from the franchise, especially after Ragnarock.It's a shame that there won't be another Avengers movie after this one, but I guess all good things come to an end."
1472,"Oct 1, 2021",10,"It's a masterpiece! Fight, acting, storyline , everything perfect."
1473,"May 3, 2019",1,Trying to avoid spoilers while expressing why so much of this film is just a fan service dues ex machina is just too difficult. A disappointing and cheap end to a decade's worth of popcorn films.
1474,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Perfect just one disappointing thing is that there was Fortnite in the movie :(
1475,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"Picks up 22 days after the climax of Infinity War with Iron Man and Nebula stranded in space and the others baffled as to what to do next. Antman re-emerges and they consider a new possible way forward.Fabulous conclusion, full of wit, sadness and wonder. Everyone is great, the effects are to die for and a very well produced line is drawn under phase 3 - let's hope phase 4 is half as good."
1476,"Jun 16, 2019",10,"After the decimation of half the universe at the hands of Thanos, the Avengers must fight to restore order to the universe once and for all in the conclusion to an 11-year, 22-film-long journey through the Marvel Cinematic Universe.If you've ever felt like all these shared universes and year-long franchises have been leading up to something, then, well, it's here. The moment fans have been waiting for since 2008 has finally arrived, culminating an already enormous franchise in a gigantic finale that's everything I wanted it to be and more. It's the most shocking and emotional movie out of the entire superhero genre, but also brings all the excitement and fun Marvel knows for while having a more somber tone than most Marvel films as well. This movie brings eleven years of cinema in a cinematic event that pays off every minute dedicated to waiting for, watching, and discussing Marvel films over the years. If you think you could get away with only watching a few of the previous films before this one, then you're wrong - in order to truly grasp the substance of Endgame like the movie wants you to, you are required to watch every film from the Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor trilogies to all the other connected adventures such as Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Captain Marvel, and of course, the first three Avengers film. After all, it has been an eleven-year adventure and, to be honest, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been the center of popular culture for as long as I've known about it and have been following it. In case you don't know, I've seen every Marvel movie in theaters since 2012 and this franchise has always had a special place in my heart. This movie is one that everyone can love, but simply going to see Endgame without any prior knowledge won't bring you as much joy and emotional payoff as that which so many fans in my theater, including myself, experienced when watching this film. The performances are all spectacular, including Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans reprising their beloved roles as the leading names of the Avengers, which have easily become the greatest characters in modern cinema. The movie does a wonderful job continuing every character arc from the previous films but still takes characters in unexpected directions, which may be why characters like Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Thor are such highlights as well. Every actor wonderfully reminds us why they were so perfect from the role, including the previously mentioned actors, as well as Mark Ruffalo who is always so enjoyable as Bruce Banner. Not to mention Paul Rudd, who is perfect comedic relief but also delivers a terrific performance overall as his character Scott Lang, better known as Ant-Man. Another character I was very impressed by is Nebula, who originates from the Guardians of the Galaxy films and is most deeply connected to Thanos from all the characters in the film. Nebula's arc has always intrigued me though many have overlooked it, and the script takes advantage of what makes her great very well and transforms her into a real hero, as opposed to her darker, villainous personality when her journey began in Guardians of the Galaxy. Telling you who else is in the film would already be a spoiler, but every cast member that does appear in the movie perfectly utilized and is very much welcomed every minute they're on screen.Remember when Avengers: Infinity War came out and everyone called it a cinematic landmark because of the incomparable scale and stakes? Well, Avengers: Endgame succeeds at topping that scale by creating something even more unimaginably enormous and climactic. Moments fans have awaited for years and buildup waiting to be payed off, it's all rewarded here in scenes you would never think to picture in your head but finally can. Audiences will continuously clap and cheer as the past films are referenced and heroes do awesome things you've always wanted them to do. This movie made me react like no movie before, and I had a huge smile on my face in some scenes that I just couldn't get rid of. Even after twenty-two films, Marvel takes unexpected directions that you wouldn't have thought of but still remain true to the long-lasting story arcs. This results in an emotionally surreal experience where you cannot tell what will happen next, or if Hollywood can ever top such a glorious event. The way Endgame handles its story serving as a climax of eleven years of cinema and as a 3-hour movie lover's dream, well, it convinces me that this is the peak of filmmaking history here. Every movie in history has always promised to ""up the ante"", but after Endgame, it's hard to see how the scale, stakes, and weight of this film can ever be topped. But that's not a bad thing. Maybe it just means that we lived in the right time, to witness such a grand phenomenon unfold in front of our eyes, and that we'll be able to tell those who come after us of the adventure we went on with these characters over the years, and the conclusion of their stories that we see here, wrapped up terrifically in one of the greatest superhero movie endings of all time, which in turn helps make up the greatest superhero movie, and one of the most astonishing action movies and blockbusters put to film in this day and age.Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic event that must be witnessed on the big screen, marking the end of an era for Marvel but one that still exceeds expectations with fantastic writing, emotional value, nostalgia, and visuals and set pieces that will be remembered for the rest of however long superhero and action movies continue to be made. Thank you, Marvel Studios, for making such a sensational universe and making the experience of being a fan an unforgettable one. I'm sure more people can agree with me on that than Thanos can snap away. You've definitely already heard of Avengers: Endgame and now that you know why you should see it, what are you waiting for? 10/10"
1477,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I just came out of the cinema and I'm still all processing what I've just seen. And I'm going back in tomorrow to soak it up again. Come back here and finish the review. I simply can't right now. What an impact it has.Just go watch, this is the worthy conclusion of the MCU."
1478,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Just got back from Endgame here in N.Z and it will make you laugh , cry , clap and be emotionally spent but it's well worth it ! cancel everything this weekend and go and see it . Endgame is the event movie of a life time ! it is superior to Infinity War for sure and Endgame fly's by the 3 hours feel more like 2 it's just that good and I can't wait to see it again plus please go in spoiler free it is so worth it there are so many surprises that were deliberately left out of any trailers ."
1479,"Apr 27, 2019",6,It had a few actually funny scenes a few great action scenes and incredible ending. Making this movie 3 hours did nothing but draw it out to be tedious and boring. It had the potential to be the 9.1 rating people are giving it if editing had trimmed a lot more of the fat. Way over rated.
1480,"Apr 26, 2019",1,"The storyline being absolutely terrible is almost unrepairable. However, they do try and fail. The bjg problem is it's finally clear the choppiness and flow are off due secrecy and too much outsourcing. In order to obacure the plot, different companies are awarded different CGI scenes without ever being told the whole enchilada so that they can't leak anything... Of course this method requires there to be a very strong movie plot to begin with or you end up with chop suey. This movie has a few moments of good laughs and one liners... And that's it. It's a total and complete failure."
1481,"Aug 16, 2019",10,"Avengers endgame is the end of the infinity saga and it is the perfect ending. I may not be good with words but this movie was amazing! I am seeing it again tomorow for the 7th time! It is a little slow in the first hour, but it makes up for it because I am invested in these characters. I am happy with what they did with Thor and hulk because it makes sense in the context of their character ark. Thanos in this movie is not as good as he is in infinity war but that was the same with the heroes. Captain America for example was not very good in infinity war but now he is amazing in endgame. People like infinity war for the villain, and I think people should like endgame for the heroes. After all, these are superHERO movies!"
1482,"Aug 3, 2019",10,"Watched crying and over and over!This is one of the best movies in the m marvel universe, I will never forget this movie."
1483,"Apr 29, 2019",10,Everyone must watch It is one of the best movie of this decade Vfx is ultimate
1484,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Such a Epic Movie Of MCU. I don't have enough word to describe the movie but it was epic,fabulous,marvelous,mind blowing,Awesome.. Just go and watch!!! Just watch!!!"
1485,"May 12, 2019",10,"Epic, exciting and filled with love and gratitude for both the characters and the fans, ""Endgame"" is everything an event movie should be."
1486,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Part of the journey is the end. We will be ok without you, now rest. Just cannot stop crying though."
1487,"Apr 28, 2019",9,"All I can say is that I've never been into the comics but this sets such a high bar maybe I missed out? I'm one who would rather watch the movie it's safe to say. Seriously this is the ultimate escapist celluloid brilliance I've witnessed in over 50-years of movies. This film is the masterpiece of the genre. What a cast too. I think after some settling I will actually feel inspired to go through the entire franchise again knowing this carrot is at the end. No criticism of any kind can I think of. Truly excellent to the point even if you're never seen anything Marvel you should step up and see Avenger's"" Endgame."
1488,"May 5, 2019",9,"About 7,500 people rated this great movie with 1/10. I wonder if they really watched it or are just DC fans... Nevertheless this is the best superhero movie of all time so far!"
1489,"Jan 25, 2024",10,"""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) is nothing short of a cinematic marvel, earning a well-deserved 10/10 stars for its extraordinary achievement in concluding numerous storylines and character arcs within a single film.

1491,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Since the very first Iron Man, every thing came to this. Imagine every feeling from all these movies in just one movie. This is without doubt the most completed movie I have ever seen."
1492,"Jul 2, 2021",9,This movie is super emotional specially for marvel fans like myself . I loved it and it was the ultimate experience one can get . I love it 3000.
1493,"May 7, 2019",7,"I'll keep it simple,This movie is good. I give it a 7,4 but IW was better (I give IW a 8,9). The first half of the movie is kind of slow, the second half is faster.You need to have seen a couple of marvel movies before you can understand what's going on in this movie. Or you have to have read the superheroes backgrounds and/or powers."
1494,"Apr 24, 2019",10,One word to describe it : BEAUTIFUL. No superhero movie like this. Ever. Never write a review before in my entire life. But this one is an exception. The MCU Project has never been this ambitious before. Crazzzyyyy
1495,"May 1, 2019",3,"That is a typical example of a movie trying to squeeze juice out of a story that falls short. X-men finished their old-cast franchise so much better, and darker, and better (sorry did I say better before...), yeah much better. Endgame is simply not up to par with the rest of the Marvell movies."
1496,"May 15, 2019",10,I don't know what it is about this film but it's just amazing.
1497,"Jan 25, 2020",10,How do you sum up the culmination of ten years of cinematic brilliance in two sentences? By simply saying it is pretty damn good.
1498,"Apr 28, 2019",10,I love everything about this movie. good job for all of people who help making this a masterpice.
1499,"Apr 30, 2019",10,Easily the best marvel film to exist. You'll most likely cry in the cinema
1500,"May 2, 2019",10,Since we started watching Iron man when we were teens up until now 11 years and 22 movies all those came to success for this movie Endgame. If it is not like this there can't be any other better ending.All of the hard work was worth it. And RDJ you made us marvel fans and you made the mcu what it is today.
1501,"Apr 27, 2019",7,Good movie & emotional but not better than infinity war and 3 hours i saw it so long and first hour was so boring and for the time travel was so Provocation any ideas for time traveling Russo brothers do what they want and don't care for our minds I Think the time travel is owned by DC sorry marvel
1502,"Sep 2, 2019",9,"After following the Marvel films for more than 10 years, it was a beautiful 'end'. The movie starts with a slow paced emotional tone and catches speed as the story goes on. Some of the goodbyes given to the main characters were heart touching while others were heartbreaking."
1503,"Apr 24, 2019",7,It was good but not great. The first hour is way to long. A nice ending and a good attempt with a lot of old references.
1504,"Feb 11, 2020",10,"Just watch this movie. Not really been a fan of the Avengers series because it's been repetitive, same Heroes, same action, but this last one i found very entertaining and for me the best one.The story gels together well,but there is a lot more emotion coming from most of the Heroes which shows their still human inside and sort of makes you feel the character more. The main thing about any movie, if you dont connect to the characters, it will not be any good.The people whom make these films from writers to special effects must be Aliens, because they are brilliant , intelligent beings to do something like this, i mean you got to be someone special to do such a massive movie like this and keep it all together and so many stars.Please bear this in mind when you watch a movie like this, how amazing the people who are involved in this."
1505,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Satisfying 3-hours in which you go through a lot of emotions. And the best feeling is when you sit in a theater with NO empty seats, and everyone goes through the same thing like you do. We all clap when there's a satisfying scene that explains or goes well with all the references in the past. We all laugh out loud at MCU's clever and silly jokes. And we all cry when there's a sad thing happening (don't want to spoil you so that's all I can say).I guess that's all you need to know to understand that it's worth it to see the movie, and definitely more worth it to see it with other fellow MCU fans. It's been 12 hours and I'm still not over the movie yet, keep talking about it. Thank you Marvel for a successful movie series. Thank you for giving us years of awesomeness. You have made and ended the journey with extraordinary storytelling. Thank you!!"
1506,"Apr 24, 2019",10,There is nothing more one can ask for. No need for hesitating even for a second about spending any amount of money for this movie.
1507,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"Thank you marvel for this wonderful movie. This movie made me laugh, cry and excited. This Movie is the ending of The infinity saga . It is truly the endgame"
1508,"Apr 27, 2019",6,Maybe my expectations were too high but in the end this move was just OK. It isn't bad - and it is a must see if you are invested in the Marvel Universe - but it isn't great. Maybe it gets lost in trying to include too many characters or maybe is Disney trying to be PC and intentionally make it try to appeal to too many people but in the end it made it less interesting. It has its crowd cheering moments and is epic - but when the big spoilers happen I almost didn't care. Hopefully Marvel can reboot with the X-men and Fantastic 4 because the current group has run its course.
1509,"Feb 15, 2020",8,"Review: After watching Infinity War in the cinema, I was pumped to see Endgame, so I avoided the rumours, even though I knew that the Ant-man's ""so-called"" time machine would play a big part in the final showdown, and I rushed to the cinema when it was released. I must admit, I did fall asleep through the whole beginning of Endgame because I found it boring, and the constant chatting got on my nerves, so I wasn't really interested in the ending. Now that I have watched it in the comfort of my own home, in other words, I can pause and rewind it when I want, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The beginning was basically the build-up to an epic ending, which was put together extremely well. I couldn't work out how they were going to cover so much ground, especially as there was a lot of characters with there own personal reasons to take down Thanos, but now that I have watched the whole film through properly, I can totally understand why the writers and directors made this 3hr extravaganza the way that they did. There were some sketchy parts in the storyline, like what actually happened to Gomorrah, were the hell was Nick Fury and why didn't they revive Vision, but the epic action scenes towards the end made up for it. The cleverly written script brought humour and intensity to an, somewhat, impossible situation, and the various twists made it a joy to watch. It didn't actually seem like it was 3hours long, which is a good thing, and it was brilliant to see all of the superheroes battling together to the very end. The visual effects were second to none, and the sad ending was unpredictable, but I hope that we will get to see some of the MCU again soon. I know that the die-hard fans were questioning the ending, especially when Captain America gave Falcon the shield, but we are yet to see the true meaning of that decision. Anyway, it's definitely a film that you can watch time and time again, especially back to back with Infinity War, so it has to get the thumbs up from me. Brilliant!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, who also brought you Pieces in 1997, Welcome to Collinwood, starring George Clooney and Sam Rockwell, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. As one of the most expensive movies ever made, with the largest Marvel marketing campaign, Disney knew that they had something special, but I doubt that they ever anticipated it's success. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. It grossed nearly $2.8 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity War's entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. As they filmed the last 2 movies back to back, I can't see another movie of this magnitude ever being made again, especially with so many A-list stars. In Phase Four we will be seeing the Black Widow in May 2020, the Falcon and the Winter Soldier coming in August 2020, a Loki movie in Spring 2021, Spider-Man 3 in Summer 2021, Hawkeye 2021 and Thor: Love & Thunder coming in the fall of 2021. In Phase Five, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, Ant-Man, Captain Marvel and Blade will be returning to the big screen, so there is a lot to look forward to. DC better pull there finger out!Budget: $356million Worldwide Gross: $2.8billion (WOW!)Genre: Action, Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Benedict Cumberbatch, Brie Larson, Tom Holland, Josh Brolin, Chris Pratt, Samuel L.

1510,"Dec 9, 2019",6,"Watching this movie I imagine screenwriters struggling to write decent scenes while the producers demand a grand, comic-book-style finale to satisfy every fan of every Avenger character. The result apparently succeeds in thrilling long-term Marvel Universe fans. For the rest of us this is a bewildering and mostly tedious mix of melodrama and overwrought FX actionI have watched, and often enjoyed, the previous films from the Marvel Cinematic franchise. So I'm familiar with the backstory of the characters. And I know to come to these movies prepared not only to suspend critical thinking but also to let my eyes glaze over during the prolonged action scenes. To the extent I was able to do this for 3 hours I was rewarded with enough situation comedy to keep me in my seat.But the melodramatic angst of the characters in the context of the plot is just irritating. Are you pining over the fact that your buddy might not survive the effort to resurrect the half of the living universe wiped out in Infinity War? Do you and every Avenger suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder?The only protagonists that hold my sympathy and respect for ""keeping it real"" are Tony Stark and Thor. (I'm not sure who merits more credit for that: their actors or their writers.) Otherwise I actually found myself rooting for Thanos: Though we may disagree with his objectives, at least he thinks big and doesn't indulge in ennui. He hews to his principles and does not hesitate to sacrifice himself for them. He is the only true hero in this movie, which makes it a tragedy."
1511,"May 2, 2019",2,"I haven't nt seen all the Marvel movies, but I've seen some - the Iron mans, the Ant mans, Cpt Marvel. I enjoyed them. I thought I'd go and see what the fuss was about. However this, is so formulaic, ridicilous and boring I couldn't take it for the whole film. I walked out after 2 hours, and it felt every bit as long as that. If you're not a huge Marvel fan already, you may well not like this film, because I feel it's somewhat self-indulgent. It's like an effort to squeeze a bit more money out of fans."
1512,"Apr 24, 2019",10,THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE OR BETTER THE BEST MOVIE EVER.I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT AGAIN

1515,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This is without a doubt the very best movie I have ever seen in my entire life and the most unexpected,most emotional movie,the events,the characters,......wow"
1516,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Well...after the depression one was left with after the Infinity War ended...This will make you clap your hand! Oops! I fear I might have mentioned too much! 3 hours it may be, but you will enjoy it. Make sure you go to the loo first before the movie start. Oh yes, if you are waiting for the credit scenes to roll...don't bother."
1517,"Apr 25, 2019",7,Dont get me wrong I did enjoy the film the first hour and a half I felt was a bit pointless but then wow it was amazing so I feel 7 is all it deserves due to the start
1518,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"""Endgame"" left me on the edge of my seat for the entire 3hours runtime. the third act really blew my mind, this movie will take you on an emotional rollercoaster."
1519,"Dec 29, 2019",10,"Best movie of the decade. As far as what it achieved and it's impact. Just like Avatar 2009 was the movie of the decade, this movie is too. Now sure it's not a 10/10 it's close though. For a movie that has so much background behind it, obstacles to achieve and a movie before it that was arguably one of the greatest last year, this movie had HUGE expectations... and it sure enough delivered... the box office tells you it all. #1 most money made from a film finally beating avatar... this is a beautiful way to close out this decade off to 2020. And DC has a win up their sleeve as well. Having Joker become the first R rated film to surpass 1 billion. They're both swinging strong this year. Good job marvel I see you, im more of a DC fan myself but I want to see them both succeed and this film deserves its 10/10 I was crying twice and laughing more and engaged."
1520,"Apr 24, 2019",10,😍 Best movie ever. I've never seen anyzhing like this. Outstanding performance.
1521,"Aug 11, 2019",1,"Infinity War by far the best Marvel by a long way. However Endgame half the film was boring and only the last 10 minutes had an resembles to Infinity war.Thick Thor, Professor Hulk brilliant the rest average."
1522,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Infinity war : 2h 40m (perfect fight scene, didn't show how they got Power Stone & Reality Stone) Endgame : 3h 2m ( last fight is epic, the perfect ending ) RIP two legends: Tony Stark & THANOS I became a fan of THANOS ""the best character ever shown in the history of cinemas"" he has 1: Power 2: Intelligence 3: Emotion but he never wanted to rule the world, that makes him the best character ever."
1523,"May 12, 2019",10,I am utterly amazed at how well the Russo Brothers intertwined the stories lines of the Avengers and bring an end to a saga. This movie makes you connect to the characters while still being an action film. Kudos to the Marvel team.
1524,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I won't say much here, this is something you need to experience yourself. Hard to comprehend the varying emotions in this movie, and I guess that's what makes this the most brilliant end, to an even better ride. Marvel has outdone itself! 10/10 for the journey.Ps - No end credit scenes. But I guess you'll be seated till the end of the credits anyway. It's hard to walk away from."
1525,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"While no rabid Marvel comic book fan, I can say I have enjoyed the Avengers and their journey. From individual films that fleshed out back story to them coming together and being the force needed has been one long memory I will cherish.Endgame was a true example of how to go out on top of your game. From the humor, the rich characters, the chemistry, the past (heartaches and joy), to the final minutes was a perfect mix and wild ride. It was a bittersweet ending. It did not need ""that particular scene"" to swell the emotions. The whole film was masterfully crafted with extra bits of care within the group.There were some flubs, sure.They did not detract from the story nor did they stand out. For me, it added to the ""human"" feels. As I said, this should become the gold standard for going out on top rather than a whimper across the finish line. Did not feel like 3 hours, it went by far too fast.If you don't see any other film this year, get to the theater for this one. It will engulf you and spirit you away from everyday."
1526,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"While watching #AvengersEndgame, I laughed too much, I clapped too much and I cried so hard. The movie exceeds every expectation and is the perfect condition of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.Watch all 21 MCU movies before watching #endgameWe love you 3000 times..."
1527,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"Avengers Endgame is the conclusion to 11 years worth of MCU build up. A 3 hour long epic superhero adventure packed with eye candy action and emotional moments that suffers from a few minor inconsistencies in story and characters. The promotional material has been incredibly vague and therefore I'll keep it too with this review too to not ruin the fun. After the 'events' of Infinity War, the Avengers are forced to reassemble and take on Thanos (Josh Brolin) once more. That's all I'll say about the plot. I was genuinely surprised with the direction that was taken for many characters. Unlike Infinity War, the heroes are in front center this time. There were genuine arcs that made me love and feel for these characters yet again and all of the actors were fantastic. Robert Downey jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth are at the centre of this movie and there characters were all the best, emotional and surprising for me. Especially Ruffalo lightened up the mood with a comedic performance. At this point the chemistry and comradeship between the Avengers is undeniably the best part of these films. Just seeing these characters on screen talking and interacting was truly amazing. The conversations and relationships they share with each other is vital to the films success and it absolutely delivers. The humour is on point, the dialogue snappy and real and the fight just as brutal and significant as before. All other actors too gave very effective performance but I will admit that there were two that disappointed me a little. Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) and surprisingly Josh Brolin (Thanos). I haven't seen Captain Marvel but the use of her character in Endgame didn't do much for me. She had no personality and Larson (a terrific actress) didn't have the inviting charisma that a Scarlett Johansson has. Whilst he stole the show in Infinity War, Brolin's Thanos is merely reduced to a big evil villain in this film. I get that most of the screen time and story was dedicated to the Avengers and that Infinity War was Thanos' movie. But if I'm supposed to judge Endgame as a film on its own, his character definitely felt underused. Some jumbled story parts that best shouldn't be overly analysed aside. Avengers Endgame is an absolutely experience from start to finish. Perhaps the best film in the MCU yet I don't know how they can possibly top this. Wrapped up with a nice bow and tie, Endgame is a satisfying blockbuster for all fans of the MCU and superhero films in general."
1528,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"I am not a typical science fiction movie fan but i love movie as long as it has good story, graphics and can make me feel become part of movie.After having watched Endgame i was literally in shock due to emotions i felt. even a sane person like me who know the difference between real life and reel life cried, smiled, laughed and man!! those goosebumps i felt during some science where Avengers get hope of success were incredible.Yes i agree first part of movie was not that fast but it was great since it built a pavement for bigger building, and also make us feel how heartbroken a man feel when he fails to save his loved once after trying everything. It make me realize the importance of loved one in my life.As a movie it is perfect. But i am sad that it ended.story line of movie without spoiling movieHopelessness/abject sadness -> hope -> courage -> sad -> hope -> courage + fun -> honor -> valor -> sad -> hopeAnd at last i love you 3000"
1529,"Jan 19, 2022",7,"""Avengers: endgame"" was supposed to become The great final of the biggest series of Marvel films containing all the main characters.What it really is what we see? I wouldn't name it The great film. Yes, the cast is good and well-known and the picture is fine and beautiful, but it didn't become that great as it supposed to be. The storyline wasn't that different from other films and the end was not such a surprise. So, go and watch it, probably for you it would be The great final."
1530,"May 15, 2019",10,"A beautiful and full filling way to end a saga lasted 10 years,"
1531,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"But I don't think it's as great as Infinity War which I think it might be better than LOTR, but still a great and amazing movie to watch, you won't regret watching it! Congrats to Russo brothers! Good job!! Thanks to Stan Lee...."
1532,"Apr 27, 2019",10,My 1st ever review. 9 is an absolute disrespect to a masterpiece. Yes. It's that great.
1533,"May 3, 2019",10,The best marvel movie ever.. It was epic!! You'll enjoy every moment of the 3hr2min movie. All I can say is.. We love you 3000 AVENGERS!!
1534,"May 21, 2019",10,What an amazing movie marvel have really use the power of it's own movie if every mistake in the others movie was just to give us these amazing moving picture then I will give all marvel movie he same rate.
1535,"Apr 30, 2019",10,By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years
1536,"Jun 8, 2019",1,Story not good .. that's way i don't like this type of move.
1537,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Great story telling, you never know what is gonna happen."
1538,"Aug 17, 2019",8,"This story-arc wrap-up starts with half the Avengers and world in general dead and no way to fix it. Only of course they figure out a way, because that was telegraphed in the last movie, and some of that goes right and some horribly wrong leading to, yet again, a massive battle.The movie is generally speaking as entertaining as the last one, although it's attempt to use it's time-travel conceit to include every single character from every cinematic marvel universe movie ever made can be wearying, with characters I don't quite remember, characters appearing too briefly to make an impact, and a tremendous number of non-speaking cameos that serve no purpose except to let the audience say, ""oh yeah, them.""The first half is pretty zippy, with lots of banter and some flat-out slapstick. But the movie also wants to delve into the self-sacrifice theme, so the movie drifts into increasing levels of sorrow.The movie ends, obviously, with a vast battle, and while it's quite good, with some serious ""wow"" moments, it is the smaller, character-driven moments that truly stand out, like two superheroes battling each other to be the one to self-sacrifice. And while the post-battle weep-fest seems a bit long, the film does end with a particularly satisfying resolution to one superhero's arc.Endgame gives you the solid, expected Avengers experience. Comedic, dramatic, special-effects driven, and overlong. It's well worth seeing even though ultimately it's nothing you haven't seen before."
1539,"Aug 21, 2021",9,"Some scenes could have been cut out and the humor was a bit over the top for me in what should've been a more serious and dark film given the stakes. But everything else was knocked out of the park. Pretty much the entire 3rd act/last hour saves it right when Black Widow and Hawkeye get to Vormir. From that point on it's near perfect Marvel material. Emotionally and action-wise with our favorite heroes, THIS is what the fans have been waiting for going on 11 years. I left the theater twice satisfied."
1540,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"What a perfect ending for avengers series, very emotional and enjoyable to watch, for the events some could be a pit better but it's very good overall."
1541,"Aug 4, 2019",10,You obviously didn't understand the film if you hate it.
1542,"Jun 17, 2022",7,"The movie is fun, but the writing leaves a lot to be desired. I was blown away by Infinity War, but this movie was a lot less impressive. The story was over stuffed, some of the plot points didn't make sense, and over all the movie seemed more concerned with shoving in humor and callbacks than with telling a well crafted story. It's enjoyable, but definitely not on par with some of the other entries in the MCU."
1543,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"Greetings again from the darkness. In what was originally titled ""Avengers: Infinity War Part 2"", we get the much-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3. Regardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this finale:Can the Avengers defeat Thanos? What role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play? Will those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life? Will Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space? Who will survive this final battle?We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, it's colossal/humongous/monumental ... whatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered quite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU entries).Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines, visually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I don't offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffic's classic ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread provided by 'Infinity War', we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than what we've come to expect.The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust me when I say, you've never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans' 10th film as Captain America, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It makes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.Since the previous and speculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that works, but that's the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at the expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.The theatre was packed with Dallas area critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few sniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional beginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters we've gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should know just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor ones. It's quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the Pepper Potts scenes.Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a 'women's movement' moment that seems to be Marvel's ""we hear you"" statement. Much of what we see is ""inevitable"", but as the Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when 'over-the-top' is 'just right'."
1544,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"To make things simple, this movie is exactly what everyone wanted it to be, including myself of course. It's a great follow-up of the ""Infinity War"" which was simply astonishing and left room for sequel as it manages to maintain the pace, quality and excitement of its predecessor throughout its entire length of over three hours. It manages to be so dramatic, filled with action like every other installment but also very thrilling. You're always kept glued to the screen, waiting for the next thing to arrive with no room for boredom. The way it presents its ideas, its story but especially its action scenes is simply unique. As you can expect, all previous Marvel characters return to the scene with their great actors, which their job flawlessly regardless of the situation.It's one of those rare movie which keep me excited from the first trailer, which generates interest even when it isn't released, which makes me search for the best place in a cinema the moment it appears just to see it as soon as possible. The great part about it though is that it didn't disappoint in any way. Although pretty lengthy, it provided a satisfying watch with a good conclusion to the franchise. I couldn't find almost anything against it, thus the only thing I can do is to award it the maximum rating that it deserves."
1545,"Jun 9, 2019",6,I was a bit excited for this title given that I really like the previous one but I ended up a bit disappointed... It's often very versatile from one Marvel to another. I found the characters' decision not really making sense in many occasions and the plot ended up not making that much sense anymore I found.
1546,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"Infinity war perfectly meshed the missing components in terms of adding the missing members of the avengers such as the guardians of the galaxy as well as the new MCU addition Spiderman as well as introducing us to Thanos wth a lot of backstory masterfully executed. It saddened and frustrated how it ended but in hindsight set the stage perfectly for endgame which got the creative juices really going with very high expectation set by its predecessor. Unfortunately it got wasted with the Russo brother pulling continuously at the string of the worlds smallest violin turning what should have been a magnificent superhero movie into a nonstop tear jerker. Though I can appreciate the underlying theme of this movie is about dealing with loss and being triumphant at the end.. It seems the former is continuously stuffed down peoples throat for at least two hours.As a poster ealier pointed out its 2 hours of crying, some action and crying again. The climax of the movie was enjoyable though it didn't cover screen time as much as it should have when it was the main reason people came to watch the movie. Theres a lot of things that happen to the movie which either don't make much sense, either happen to quick or just illustrate lazy writing assuming the viewer will fill in the gaps with a lot of cheesy content which gets you thinking 'really'. It almost seems as though they had put thought into how they wanted the story to end but didn't put much creative thought to the journey leading to the climax as simply cobbled whatever they may have left out of the MCU in the previous movies into this for fan service. As an MCU fan I would still advise people to view it as its end of this saga but don't believe a lot of the hype that's on this review board or you will be immensely disappointed."
1547,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Avengers Endgame is the best by far. All Marvels Cinematic Universe movies come together beautifully.

1550,"Aug 12, 2019",10,"I am a big marvel fan. When I saw infinity war's ending I was immediately excited for this movie. This was easily my most anticIpated movie of the year and probable of all time. When tickets went on sale I got some for the midnight premiere immdiately. And somehow dispite my high expections this movie destroyed them and created a even better movie then I could have imagined.I loved every second of this movie. Even the first act were most people have complaints I loved. The second act is better then the first but man that final act is just masterpiece. Every cast member from beginning to end is amazing with Robert Downey Jr and Chris Even's being standouts. And thats not easy since I think everyone gave their best performance here and are all able to draw emotions from you. Now some directions charectors take will be not suite everyone. In fact how the avengers deal with the events of infinity war isn't gonna go well for everyone. But I for one loved it. Lead to a few cheer moments. But if you wanna talk about cheer moments man that final act. No spoilers but I wanted cheer at many moments. Two moments I nearly jumped out of my set. But while it's mostly laughs and smiles when this movies wants you to feel man it'll make you feel. If you've been a long time fan (you've probable already seen it but anyway) you will choke up I know I did and I feel no shame admitting it.If you want max enjoyment out of this film. Watch the rest of the movies. I know it sounds demanding but it's worth it. Cause you'll understand meaning behind stuff. I saw it with my dad and the two moments I nearly jumped out of my seat over he was thinking ""Ah ok"" so yes do watch the other movies if you haven't before you see this one.In the end Avengers: Endgame is in my opinion is one of my favourite movies of all time and the best marvel movie to date and I dought that will change. I know I didn't say much about the movie but I'm trying to be spoiler-free and the trailers show like nothing of the movie and thats what I based my can I talk about this ot not kinda mind set. But I can't describe how satisfied I was. This truely was an end of an era and I all I can say is I am so glad to be apart of it. To follow these charectors and become connected to them and then to finally see the conculsion thia masterpiece of a story was more then worth the wait."

1553,"Apr 26, 2019",8,Avengers infinity War was one of those heart stopping movies. It had everything going on and it just worked out perfect. Going into End Game I had high expectations and was sadly disappointed. The movie was very underwhelming. May I even say boring at times.
1554,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This movie made me feel every emotion humanly possible and then some. As a huge Marvel fan, not just of the movies, this film took me places! What a rollercoaster ride of emotions and the cinematography was beautiful. A very complex story made enigmatically seamlessly. Thank you to the Russo's! Can't wait to put this on the end of the canon once it's realized to purchase! A must watch in theaters!!! Best version of Hulk ever!"
1555,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"It's bold, brilliant, awesome and heartbreaking. This is the best way the Avengers films could have ended, and soo much more. I absolutely love it"

It's a story about family - both gained and blood - and it opens so many different possibilities to the future! I was laughing and crying at the same time. The cast is obviously amazing - but shout out to Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Karen Gillian."
1557,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Just saw the film. Beautiful. Funny. Sad. Awesome. My friend and I can gladly say this film summates the vigorous journey that we have all been on since the first Iron man in 2008. The Russo's have wonderfully done it again, with this film out-shining many of their previous films, and many of the other marvel films. This film has the ability to manage a complicated storyline having eleven years and twenty-two films lying on its shoulders, and yet still is able to incorporates stunning visuals, brilliant acting, great dialogue, beautiful cinematography, score, and more. The film is hands-down, the best film marvel has created. It beautifully captures the true heart, love, and pain that these films have always produced for the fans. It is amazing. I myself, will be remembering this one for years.Enjoy it, you earned it. The long await has finally come.P.S. I feel like this film is honestly Oscar worthy. Robert Downey Jr's performance is amazing, where he beautifully captures this extensive journey of material in film, which all started with him. His time and effort, which has created this cultural phenomenon deserves praise. Also, the Russo brothers. These comedically genius brothers have positively made their mark in cinema, through this film. If they do not receive a nomination for either best director, or the film isn't nominated for best picture, I don't know what the academy is doing. I know they don't normally go for comic book movies, but this, this is something different.Have fun people."
1558,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"This movie is a masterpiece, no other film can match the epicness of this"
1559,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This is the finale the marvel cinematic universe deserves and it is a masterpiece. It surpasses your expectations no matter how high they are. The way they put together everything in place, the comedy, the drama ,the action, everything on point. Thanos - The most badass villain in the history of cinema. The Final act - Perfection. The directors could not have done it better even if they wanted too. Watching it once is not enough."
1560,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"To keep this short and sweet, Avengers Endgames is one of the most visually pleasing movies of the year next to Alita Battle Angel. But what stops short is the political messages driven into this movie. Socialist activist, people who cry over star wars trailers and folks who say the world will end in 12 years will love this movie and won't miss a beat. But for those who are more attune and aware of forced idealism in entertainment to push across a progressive narrative may find it overpowering and in your face a certain moments. Other aspects left me a little disappointed as well, but not enough to get up and leave the theatre. Also to eveeyone giving this ten stars. Check out their activity and user names. Someone is really trying to boost this movie."
1561,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"DC can't even chase the tail of the Marvel, anyone who left a bad comment of this movie must be someone meant to do so, it reminds me 11years ago when I was a kid and watched the first movie of iron man I was attracted by MCU with those wonderful imagination and heroism. This is the best endgame for all these 11years of love I can not explain how I am feeling with my poor English, but this for sure is the best marvel movie ever."
1562,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Fantastic 3001 times, salute!!, thank you thank you thank you verrryyy muchh"
1563,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I am just speechless at this point. There aren't words available in the dictionary to provide justice to the magnum opus that Avengees Endgame is. Kevin Feige and the Russo brothers have just outdone themselves. You could say that infinity war had some flaws in its narrative context. BUT ENDGAME IS THE PERFECT SUPERHERO MOVIE. One of my most favourite films of all time PERIOD. It manages to live up to the expectations of hardcore fans to the maximum and so much more. General movie going audiences will also enjoy this as it is in many ways its own movie and doesn't depend too much on previous installments. Do yourselves a favour guys and watch it ASAP. TRULY A MASTERPIECE
1564,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I can introduce this movie to one of the best marvelstudios films. This is movie really masterpiece!!! I rated this 10/10!
1565,"May 14, 2019",10,"Movie Is Filled With Humor , Action , Thriller , Deaths And Many More. There Would Be Scenes That Would Make Your Tear Ozzing Out Of Your Eyes."
1566,"May 9, 2019",10,You guys went to the cinema and said can I have tickets to endgame but I guess they gave you Justice League tickets. This movie was amazing and Seb tell your boys to chill.
1567,"Aug 30, 2020",9,Best movie i just love it. It the best movie of the decade i guess everyone reading this must watch this movie.
1568,"May 9, 2019",10,"The movie gave us everything we wanted.. No doubt, this is the best movie of the century"
1569,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"What a remarkable journey it is for Marvel Cinematic Universe. I don't think anything can accomplish this kind of achievement in another franchise universe. This is indeed one of a kind.To everyone contributing in the making of this universe, producers, story writers, directors, actors, CGI makers, and everyone involved, from the bottom of my heart, I say thank you very much for the experience, the sensation, the excitement, the wonders you guys brought to the movies.."
1570,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Such a perfect ending to an epic ride for many many years. It got better and better and found its perfection in this very movie. Everything just fitted and at the same time it was so surprising and genuine good writing and editing. All to the point. Only downside has probably been that you overdid it a lil bit with Thor. Infinity war almost the main character with such a cool curve and in this movie more of a goober. But for the sake of the epicness of the rest of the wild ride I'll forget about that.
1571,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Loved this movie as I have loved all other Avengers movies...bar one..Captain Marvel. So glad she (Brie Larson) was only in it for a short time or I would have scored it less. Loved the humour and the old familiar Avenger Heroes. Chris Helmsworth was hilarious. Robert Downey Jnr was brilliant as were the others.
1572,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"This movie was so overhyped so it hurt the review but it's a better then average movie. The beginning is slow which is fine cause it usually creates tenseness; however, the movies pacing jumps along to going fast and then back to slow. It's pacing is bad and vary irritating. There were many unexplained plot holes too. Usually this is fine but the audience needs details especially in a lore as deep as marvels. There was too much emotion and it didn't have to end the way it did. Still is a must see and a good film, just not the conclusion we needed."
1573,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Marvel keep improve in all its movie. And this is one of the best films that marvel has ever made
1574,"Apr 26, 2019",7,It was good. Just like the last one. But it's not very different from any marvel movie. They have become repetitive and predictable . Many cliches
1575,"Sep 8, 2019",3,"Three hours wasted, was about as good as declawing my dog and at least I like the dog. The storyline was terrible, and for many blatantly obvious reasons made no senses, to make matters worse it seemed to have more holes in it, than my old gym socks. Yes I know all the good guys weren't going to make it, everyone knew that, I actually hoped a few wouldn't make it, and that's not what I care about, this movie was rubbish it labored three hours to get to the point of dead good guys/bad guys then victory and bang happy ever after for two minutes then over. This is going straight in the never watch again list, unless trapped on a plane in which case fingers crossed for a parachute, but will jump without one."
1576,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Mind-blowing man what an end You people are gonna love this😍😍 There are fight scenes which are amazing and the jokes 😂😂 and the emotional scenes which will make people cry 😭😭😭 Overall I give 10/10 for this movie Great effort by the Russo brothers and the cast and the whole team dedicated to do this film
1577,"Apr 24, 2019",10,What an epic end to the saga. I stopped eating my popcorn halfway and forgot I had a drink too. It's just that good.
1578,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I can say is this was one of the best cinema experiences of my life. I don't think you can top the ending of this movie. My jaw was on the floor, e writhing I've ever wanted in a comic book film."
1579,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I came into this movie expecting so much and boy did it deliver. I was 22 when iron man first came out and and ever since then all the avengers characters have felt like a part everyones family who love the mcu avengers. I dont know how i feel now happy sad empty all in one. I need to watch it again to digest it first time watch you are sitting there going wow wow wow!!!This film is definitely the one of the best i dont think we will see a film this emotional big for a very long time. The way film is presented is awesome one scene u might be crying from sadness or happiness and it will cut to the next and you will crying from laughter. It gets a big thumbs up for its comedy. Its drama was on point every one knows something big is going to happen to our avengers but it doesn't matter you still can't prepare yourself. It like losing a pet whos been apart of your life for 10 plus years.As the saying goes all good things must come to an end if only there was another way.Enjoy this movie
1580,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"It's hard to rate this movie in any fair way. As a movie in itself it's maybe not the most fantastic thing you've seen, it's no Pulp Fiction, Her or Forest Gump. But as a movie in a series of films this is amazing. The different stories that has been told through Marvels characters all come together here in a perfectly balanced way. As all things should be.Seeing grown up men and women laughing, crying and cheering for their favourite hero is something I find fascinating and it's hard to find this kind of interaction in the cinemas. I simply love it."
1581,"Jul 31, 2019",10,First Time i saw the movie in 3D. It was a great experience for me. It's awesome movie. I'm a big fan of MCU.
1582,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"Was very entertaining, marvel hasn't really put a foot wrong compared to DC. Feels like the end of the franchise too an I need not need to see anymore from the franchise. Thanks for the memories maybe?"
1583,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I am immensely honoured to be existing in this monumental era of time to be able to experience the vast complexity and extravagance of the MCU, as it flourished with each subsequent film. It has been one hell of a ride, but unfortunately - all good things must come to an end... and this film met this end with great success."
1584,"Aug 3, 2019",10,It is a beautiful film and worth watching and has a special artistic touch I swear..... Reda El Alaoui
1585,"Aug 15, 2019",10,"I am stunned by the 10+ years of the MCU and how they were able to bring it all together. Magnificent! However, I hate Captain Marvel. I shudder to wonder what will come of the MCU under her guidance and direction. Black Widow could have/ should have carried the torch. Please don't make any more Captain Marvel movies. I'm begging you."
1586,"Aug 20, 2019",9,"Best superhero movie created ever it has besrt screenplay, story, action and full entertainment like a perfect package"
1587,"Apr 28, 2019",10,You have seen a zillion movies and think you know everything a film maker can do .And then you watch this and all that ego shatters to dust. I never can believe the emotion the film brought in me . The one line (spoiler alert) that I AM IRON MAN destroys you away. Just unbelievable
1588,"May 2, 2019",7,"Let's face it: It was the most anticipated movie of the XXI century, thus a lot of expectations for the makers to reach, which is not an easy task.I would say they did it, they even surprised us, But was it the ending the way we want it? Mostly yes, and in my opinion it's a very good ending.BUT, the lack of action (imagine my kids 2.5 hours without actions...) and the way they show Earth with supposedly ""ONLY"" half the population should have disappeared but looks like 95% disappeared (half is not 95%) made me remove 2 stars on the 10/10Is the lack of action exacerbated the movie? No, not for adult as the scenario was well written, but for the younger staying 2.5 hours sitting and expecting action from their favorite super heroes was hard to manage in the cinema... and even for me, though ;) minus 1 star...No need to say that no one from my family wanted to stay to see the end credits... But in the end of the day, every ones found that the movie and the way it ends was good but not that good!"
1589,"Apr 27, 2019",2,Thanos please Snap this Movie is bad Script writing!
1590,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Wow.wow.wow.wow.wow. The culmination of 22 MCU movies leaves you just saying wow. They did it. They pulled it off. Thank you.
1591,"Jul 11, 2022",10,Truly the greatest movie I've ever seen. Every single filmmaking aspect is beyond perfect. Reaching this saga climax crates the strongest emotions. The cast & crew give it their all. An achievement that can't be topped.
1592,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"You can't ask more than this from the makers of movies like these...... Just remember, they have given you a memorable gift which will stay with you forever! And this indeed makes the movie itself and you a special entity! Avengers Infinity War & Endgame....A movie which is making/has made a class of it's own!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
1593,"Apr 28, 2019",10,All MCU premieres are good but hats off to Sir stan lee for a remarkable ending.
1594,"May 8, 2019",7,"First of it will remove your stress if you are thinking about what will be the next or what will thanos do. That's it. Beside that, this movie is almost like crap. Sometimes they want to be serious, sometimes funny, sometimes emotional. What a mess. They had created a hype by Infinity War and now break all the records. I think all credit goes to Infinity war. They should have to take time to write a good screenplay. I guess they don't take time because the hype will be damaged. And now give the people a crap."
1595,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Just watch it. It is amazing. Especially if you are invested in this Avengers/Marvel universe
1596,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"She is a minor character just like many others we have met throughout the years, helping out in the fight against Thanos.The movie is at times a little bit slow and dark (also in the literal sense), but is ultimately a worthy final chapter in Marvel's 22-film saga.There is exactly one 10-second ""girl power"" moment in the movie, so for those who worried that Endgame would become a ""SJW mess"", it isn't."
1597,"May 3, 2019",10,This movie was incredible I did like avengers infinity I thought no over marvel film would top it but some how avengers end game has beat marvel movie ever and one of the best of all time.
1598,"Jul 9, 2020",8,Rereleasing was not a flag ship kind of thing. Yet great movie. And will look forward to see Katherine Langford in coming marvel movies.
1599,"May 2, 2019",8,"End Game is pretty hyped as one of the best movies. And it is a great movie. The directors succeeded in connecting bits and pieces from the past and the present. While making all actors shine and draw the viewer in a hurricane of emotions. But as a result, the movies pacing feels messy, slow, repetitive and fragmented.That doesn't hurt the movie, because it's greatest strength is in the actors, mainly Tony Stark who has the superpower to carry this movie by himself. Further there is the fanservice to include almost every relevant star from the past many movies. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a high octane action movie with compelling fights. Those fights where there, but they were quick, messy, chaotic.This movie's biggest sin is absolutely not that it is a bad movie. It's good, but not as good as Infinity War, and that's a shame. All flaws aside, End Game is an emotional roller coaster, that works as a worthy goodbye to not only some actors, but a complete sage."
1600,"Apr 28, 2019",10,It is truly the best movie ever.. I cried my eyes out.. I think we got attached to it in a way we couldn't imagine.. Great experience and a must.. Thanks marvel for this perfect masterpiece
1601,"May 10, 2019",3,"I found this movie confusing and fragmented ...all over the place. It appears that Thanos, even without the infinity stones can kick ALL the Avengers butts. What???"
1602,"May 11, 2019",10,"It's the most amazing and most ambitious mile stone in movie history of mankind. This movie unite people than any movies ever will. I see all my friends, my family, even my co-workers every age, gender and color go to this movie together like no movie ever did before. This is one unique movie experience and ever will be."
1603,"Apr 28, 2019",8,"My spoiler free review of Avengers Endgame: The best MCU movie. The theatre I was in went totally nuts. It had spectacular action, it was surprisingly funny, and emotionally captivating. It manages a large roster of well developed characters which are very well executed, everyone gets a moment to shine. Delightful throwbacks to previous outings as well as smartly placed pop culture references. A truly satisfying finale for the 22movie and 11 year story arc which we have come to love."
1604,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"The movie picks up faster than Infinity War, and the third act is one of the best moments in cinematic history!"
1605,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"What a great film, it has everything you want in a film.Storyline is great, the CGI parts are crazy good.10 out of 10."
1606,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"Good but this has the most problems out of any phase 3 marvel film. Time travel is cheesy, none of the acting was EXCEPTIONAL except for RBJ. They didn't know what to do with Thor or hulk but they didn't really focus on them too much so its fine. Captain Marvels character is terrible. None of the time travel stuff makes sense and they keep breaking rules. Why is CA on the bench I thought it created an alternate timeline. When nebula was caught why didn't she GET OUT OF THERE. Your particles still work LEAVE. Why can't Captain Marvel snap the gauntlet, she's the strongest avenger. Anyway it was still good, it's kinda just pros vs cons but it was fun (except for the first two acts)."
1607,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"I'll be honest and if people hate me, whatever. If you don't love this movie you are not a true fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This is what we've been waiting for. This is it. It's the perfect MCU movie. It is literally everything we ever wanted and everything we could ever ask for. It's everything. It's the most important comic book movie there is.It's Marvel's truest identity. You laugh so hard the you jerk out in your seat. You're jaw drops from how shockingly awesome it is. You cry because of the joy fullness you're witnessing. And you cry for a happy sadness that is the ending of an era.There is not one thing I can think of that would be considered a negative. I can finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe."
1608,"Mar 25, 2021",3,"I didn't like that they had to downgrade Thor and Hulk just make Iron Man and Captain America the ones that save the day. On infinity war, when Thor arrives to earth with the day."
1609,"May 12, 2019",10,"Marvel did an amazing job, nothing could be better in the next phase."
1610,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Out of all the hundreds and hundreds of movies I have seen in my life, nothing even comes close to comparison to Endgame. This is not just ""another super hero movie"" this movie will tear your soul apart and have you screaming in joy in the seat of your chair. From stunning cinematography, to absolutely superb acting this movie encompasses the epitome of a movie going experience. Hats off to the Russo brothers for creating and giving the devoted marvel fans a perfect ending to a saga that has become a close part of all of our lives."
1611,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"An awesome film which caps off the last 10 years, leaving plenty of questions and plenty of different ways the MCU could go, it is going to be interesting to see how the next 10 years go in MCU!"
1612,"Apr 29, 2019",10,The best marvel movie to ever be created. The movie is visually stunning and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more and more. This movie will leave you in shock and tears.
1613,"Sep 7, 2019",6,"""I created this account only to give this movie a 1"", or ""I give this a 5 rating but am voting it a 1 just to lower the undeserved high rating"", and of course all the comedians and trolls and the holier than thou of moviedom that give various reasons for trying to adjust this movie's merits, or lack thereof. These are the kind of disappointing reviews I am writing about. Stop adjusting and come to the realization that you didn't get what you wanted from it. Others did.Here's what I think. There was a good mix of action and dialogue. You know, dialogue, the part that tells the story? The CG and non-CG special effects worked for me. The story was a little weak. Time travel is a subject that is still fiction, so I feel no need to try and pick apart the theoretical inconsistencies. Some make the comment that there was too much going on in trying to bring the whole MCU into this movie and that the idea may have been a bad one. Now this is the kind of comment that is useful in a review. I won't say more, since just about anything else could be a spoiler. It was a good 6 out of 10, so I am giving it a 6."
1614,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"If you are a Marvel Fan and has watched all the marvel movies since Iron Man (2008) then this movie will be surely an emotional Ride for you. The direction of this movie is just brilliant. The action, the screenplay, the ending is top notch. A movie just can't get better than this!"
1615,"Apr 27, 2019",10,I never thought I would like a movie this much until this. #lotsoflove#Ironman#Captain America#avengers
1616,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"This is best superhero movie that I ever watch. The storyline was great and powerful with its emotion weight and great treatment to all the characters. If you think Infinity War is more to Thanos storyline,then don't be disappointed because this is the Avengers movie. The movie also bring us to the journey where you can remember the movie what it's supposed to be. 30 years from now, I guarantee that you will introduce and share the love of this movie to your child or grandchild."
1617,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"The Russo brothers really did an amazing job at going full circle with this movie and paying respect to the previous Marvel movies. You will laugh, cry and repeat."
1618,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Just go watch it! It is worthy! Captain America, Thor, Everyone!!! And Tony.. omg.. 😃 best movie made by Marvel!"
1619,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Before I saw the movie I was little worried that all the hype gave too much expectations for endgame. My worries were pointless. It is hard to describe how good the movie was. It had all the things what makes a movie great and it was fastest 3 hours ever. Best film I have ever seen. I have always been a huge marvel fan and now I am so proud to say that the movie was everything I wanted and more.
1620,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Is an historical event, a changing life experience, gamechanger"
1621,"May 1, 2019",4,"People have no idea how to review things anymore,they all just put 10/10 because of hype and this is the last of the series..No this movie is the best thing of all time,its NOT a perfect work of art nor masterpiece,in fact its very poorly done and had a pathetic ending. I real waste of my money and time. Things all started going downhill after Infinity War..Thor is a one big giant joke,hes not godly,epic,interesting or manly anymore hes just a big man child. Hulk was always a bit more comical which is fine but now its on this whole new level of stupidity. Ironman is the only one with any character left and yet even Robert Downey Jr has to suffer when pitted against such terrible writing. Things just happen that dont make sense, characters suddenly become moronic and the entire build up of epic moments is taken down into this ultra cringe scene that ruins the whole plot.The constant misplaced child humor and the attempts to make ever little scene into a Disney baby movie is sickening. Things can't be taken seriously anymore or its too offensive,everything needs to be dumbed down into this childish mush so the general public can clap their hands and drool. I'm really glad this series is over with before they burn it into the ground more..Yet i cant help but think about all the other comics that will be ruined with this writing style..Are IQs really so low now that this is what counts as a ""good"" movie?!"
1622,"May 1, 2019",10,"Watching this movie I was amazed that something like this was even possible! We have come such a long way!The Endgame was totally worth the wait and lived up to every sky high expectation set for it by Infinity War. This movie has laughs, cries, gasps, and sighs of relief. The last hour of the movie had my jaw dropping. The time and care put into each frame of the movie shows.Endgame is truly the end....the end of a 21 movie story arc, we say goodbye to some of our most beloved characters as well as further embrace others. This movie truly is the swan song of the MCU. It isn't perfect but as the saying goes, ""there is grace in their failings."""
1623,"Jul 7, 2019",10,It can't get any better than this. A perfect end to the story.
1624,"Sep 23, 2019",9,"A masterful epic - a true culmination of 22 films that not only concludes the story, but expands upon it. You'll learn more about the other movies while this one unfolds. If Infinity War is the brawn, Endgame is the brains. And wow, what an ending!"
1625,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I am not particularly a huge supporter of superhero movies. But I believe that Avengers Endgame was one of the best movies of the year. The plot, the cinematography, character development; it was all there. From beginning to end I was on the edge of my seat and filled with emotion. Good job, Marvel."
1626,"May 12, 2019",9,It was an emotional rollercoaster to say the least if you are coming into marvel for the first it may not impact you the way it impacted me and you may not understand much but if you love marvel and invested in marvel i highly recommend seeing endgame.
1627,"May 20, 2019",3,The movie is unlike its precursors unamusing and dull.
1628,"Apr 26, 2019",10,A great movie. A must watch for marvel fans. It will take another 5-6 years to get to this hype.
1629,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Perfect! perfect movie! I can say without a doubt this movie is my all time 1# favorite. Well directed and written. It's time for Hollywood to give awards out and show some respect for superhero movies. (Best movie , best actor and etc)"
1630,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"No spoilers....and please don't spoil for others as well. It is a movie that you must watch if you are mcu fan. Overall movie is amazing, nicely directed and great mix of comedy and emotions just like other mcu movies 😍👌🏻"
1631,"Apr 24, 2019",10,The end that a saga of this magnitude needes! Very nice plot that doesn't let you get bored.
1632,"Apr 25, 2019",6,The film has no pace besides the big battle that in fact is to short and feels like nothing according to what I expected for a new fight with e thanosSome character directions of important heroes like Thor and hulk where ridiculous . And these characters contributed nothing to the stories besides transmitting weaknessAlso the movie was overwhelmed by overpowering woman and non white characters . I understand the need to give equal importance to every king of heroe but not to the cost of the most importa ones .Also the script was full of things without logic
1633,"May 8, 2019",3,"I watched this film on the opening day and I left disappointed. This movie is too fast paced and too easy plot with tons of loopholes. Infinity War was a great film compared to it and Guardians of Galaxy, Ironman series, Captain America 1 were far better movies than this one. Endgame is running on hype and the total collection seems huge because of way too overpriced movie tickets. This movie is made for only children of age under 12."
1634,"May 7, 2021",10,What a masterpiece! An amazing conclusion (although it was really sad)
1635,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Avengers endgame is what 21 movies led up too and I promise I that this movie blew expectations no surprise if that but also made our 10 year journey a thrill ride I thank u marvel u made us connect with these heroes along the ride from the very begging ( Iron man 2008) to this masterpiece . this movie had everything us fans wanted and way more kudos to the Russo brothers u both have done an outstanding job I literally love u guys because u both knew what we wanted . this movie was a 100/100 no lie this movie will stick in our hearts forever and again I thank u marvel . this movie had it all joy,sadness,excitement , great super hero moments , dark, light there was absolutely nothing wrong here no surprise to that aswell. All in all I can finish up by saying thank u avengers for everything this movie shocked the he'll out of me and I couldn't help but to cry tears of joy when the end credits rolled on I cried not once or twice but four times this was truly the perfect conclusion and aswell as a new beginning"
1636,"Apr 24, 2019",6,"Avenged Endgame serves as a super nice popcorn movie. But the building-up for the final battle happens way too slow, way too dull. The battle itself is epic but ends too soon in my opinion. Some of the punchlines in the film seem too contrived and almost bored me into tears. The movie tries to dig in all the main characters but fails to convey the depth. With that said, the visual and sound effects do deserve being appreciated in an IMAX movie theater."
1637,"Apr 29, 2019",3,What a boring long movie. OK special effects are great. But the story line is boring. Nothing happens in first 90 minutes. The rest of the movie is a lot of fuss about some stones. Boooooooooring! I was happy the long sit was over. I read the reviews here and I honestly do not understand why people are so enthusiastic about this movie.
1638,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This movie is great great closure to this saga.. Show the present, remembers the past and visualize a little bite of the future"
1639,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"All i can say is its perfect. It made us laugh, scream, happy and cry. It doesn't feel 3 hours at all. Congratulations to everyone in this movie."
1640,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Never Thought a day like This would Come.. When i Recall Those nostalgic memories .. Thanks For This Era Im Lucky i got to live in it. Avengers Forever
1641,"May 2, 2019",10,Awesome 💙💙 I've been enjoying whole the movie 💚
1642,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"No words to describe the fabulous Endgame. Perfectly pictured finale, brought all pieces together, mixed with action, comedy, emotion, all what you want in an entertainer. All the characters have done their part. 11 years of awesomeness is very well concluded in this massive movie. It's big. I'll have to watch again. Just finished the midnight show."
1643,"Apr 24, 2019",7,"Can you use the prism of film criticism on a unicorn like the conclusion of a 22 film arc, two parter superhero extravaganza?Probably not.But even comparing it with other Marvel films or even Infinity War, this is an indulgent party which overstays its welcome. Like a constant rush of sugar, and some of those sugar highs are gloriously fun, at the end you are ready to say ""Goodbye"" and eager for something of substance.The major issue is that once time manipulation is introduced, then any existential threat is reversible.The first hour is ploddingly slow, the cast are good but boy they look tired and Capt. Marvel goes close to stealing the film.Despite that any film lover will have to see this...an event rather then cinema."
1644,"Apr 29, 2019",10,Honestly Endgame is the one of the best movie in the world Youll laugh You'll amaze And you'll cry Forget the time travel theory's Otherwise it's best movie of all time
1645,"May 18, 2019",1,It is getting very boring now. not realistic at all
1646,"Apr 27, 2019",8,This film is incredible and emotional on so many levels. It was worth the wait
1647,"Nov 8, 2021",10,"I just have to said that im grateful for this movie. The effects, the characters is all amazing. I love how its sad joyeful and a lot of emotions in a movie."
1648,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"The film was moving, stunning, emotionally driven, and filled with deep meaningful stories, and authenticity throughout. RBDJ deserves an Oscar nom for this performance, as does the film and its leaders as a whole.There were sniffles from beginning to end, laughs, claps, gasps, and a tangible optimism and heartfelt camaraderie in the theater.This film was brilliant across the board."
1649,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"Not much to say other than without a doubt the best Marvel movie made to date! A fantastic, emotional, well scripted film that will leave you feeling fulfilled.....but with also a couple of unanswered questions! I can't say anymore than go watch this film!"
1650,"Apr 26, 2019",8,Best superhero movie ever you most watch you will never forget
1651,"Apr 26, 2019",6,A film to make it unpredictable should not be sacrificed like this. should not be watched with great expectation. I am very sad.
1652,"May 2, 2019",6,"I am not a big fan of Marvel movies. They are on average pretty dumb, makes no sense, and no internal logic or coherence, and usually ends with a horrible CGI massive and boring battle. This movie is exactly like that. But like most Marvel movies it is also very fun. The first two third of even better than average, the first act being 'The Leftovers' - Marvel edition, and the second act a fun heist movie, but the ending is so by the book and uninspiring that I was quite underwhelmed overall. If you want to see good action - MI6 last year put the bar very high, and this movie was not even close."
1653,"Jun 11, 2019",1,"Just watched this in fast-forward. i simply cannot digest this universe where in one hand high tech space travel magic creatures are living along with dump low tech planetlings , so i guess that the majority of the fans are identifying them self to those lowlifes. and the most irritating for me is how low modern they dress them self in this marvel universe."

1655,"May 4, 2019",9,Everyone should go and watch it in the theatre. Ironman is simply the best👍 I didn't know that 3hrs was that short and it disappeared like the other half with a snap from Thanos. 'I love you 3000' from a DC fan.
1656,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"We got everything we wanted and more. Great storytelling, great effects, simply a rollercoaster of feelings ... i knew i should brought tissues ... but I didn't."
1657,"Apr 29, 2019",6,Storyline was quite awful really as much as I enjoy the marvel films
1658,"May 27, 2019",1,Endgame was hands down the worst entry in the Marvel cinematic universe. I've had random bouts of depression ever since i saw this film. It ruined so many of the films that preceded it i have no words. Zero stars if i could.
1659,"May 3, 2019",10,Awesome movie epic movie this is a perfect end of infinity saga.......
1660,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"Absolutely heart breaking from beginning to end. I'm not going to sit here and spoil the movie for anyone, but if you love Marvel movies you'll love this."
1661,"May 28, 2019",9,"Thought it was solid. Everything was intense as hell until that gay ass ""girl power"" scene during the final battle."
1662,"May 1, 2019",10,"This perfectly ties the entire Avengers ""series"" together, with an ending that left me sad but content. Marvel does INCREDIBLE with every movie but this one hit different. If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest refreshing yourself with some past movies, obviously there are a ton of references and ties from the entire story."
1663,"Nov 28, 2021",10,"I am a big fan of marvel movies but avengers is my all time favourite and this time mavel has rocked out. The best superhero movie i have ever seen. This movie has everything we need in a movie, it has action, comedy, emotions and all so this is the best movie."
1664,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Love this movie gonna watch again and again till satified. As Chris Evans said ""i laughed, i cried, then laughed again"". I literally felt humble after the movie, i even stayed till the last credit lines."
1665,"Jun 3, 2020",10,"All of these 1 and 2 star reviews, WHAT movie did these people watch?"
1666,"May 5, 2019",10,"What's there to say? The film met or exceeded all of my expectations. Although an inferior sequel to Infinity War, it still is an epic and noteworthy film. It's a must watch!"
1667,"Apr 25, 2019",10,Entertain yourself not more New movie came out.. I watched it.. it was incredible absolutely recommend it to everyone out there.... this movie is the real MVP and the best there is... And the ending was just amazing It perfectly fit onto the marvel saga and it was the best marvel movie hence the visual effects.
1668,"Dec 2, 2021",10,"It's been just over a decade since Marvel Studios launched its flagship franchise of interconnected comics-inspired movies with 2008's Iron Man, and even now it's difficult to begin to evaluate how much that franchise has changed the face of filmmaking. After 10 years, 21 films, nearly a dozen television shows, countless tie-in comics and games and merchandising options and viral videos, and billions upon billions of dollars in earnings, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become the Holy Grail that every major studio is questing after, usually with little success."
1669,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I loved every second of the movie. Plot was amazing and there could never be a perfect ending on what they did in this movie. Kudos to Marvel Studios!
1670,"May 8, 2019",7,"After Dark Knight, this is the best superhero movie. Immaculate justice to the 21 films."
1671,"May 2, 2019",1,"THE WORST !!! they turned what should have been the best comic book plot, into a bollywood melodrama, it's just pathetic. don't waste your time watching babies material."
1672,"Apr 29, 2019",10,I dont know any movie that had a 3rd act better then this... the final battle made me feel like i was on 100 pounds of cocaine
1673,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"The movie is amazing. I never thought they would ve able to surpass their own amazing job with Infinity War but they did. Where the movie truly shine is in its third act, it is just beautiful. I felt like a little kid watching the whole thing. Simply astonishing."
1674,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I'm from Iran and unfortunately due to the sanctions, no theater screens avengers endgame here.so i had to watch it in hdcam. But when i did, it didn't feel bad and i really enjoyed the quality of the movie. But about the film it self: first of all, this film will make you cry and it will break and heal your heart at the same time. It will do it so beautifully that you will never forget it. I watched the endgame 3 times in a row today and honestly I think I'll watch it again. I enjoined Every second of the movie. Thank you marvel, god bless you."
1675,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Things you never expected take place in the movie, it takes us through a journey of all the characters. There is no such emotion which the movie lacks, right from humour,joy to grief. I'll definitely watch it over and over again. And last but not the least, thank you Avengers."
1676,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"This is a awesome movie with some great moments that had the whole theater fired up and cheering , little slow for the first 30 in the beginning but gets so exciting and doesn't feel Ike like a 3 hour movie. Take the family and go see it."
1677,"May 4, 2019",6,"This is average movie. I see after everyone see but during watching movie, it is average boring movie. I except lot more from this movie. Infinity movie is the best."
1678,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Made me cry lol I've never cried at any movie or TV show before
1679,"Sep 5, 2019",3,"What the?......how could i have enjoyed Infinity war so much and find this to be a bunch of total incoherent crap? leave the Time Traveling to the experts like Dr Who. I wont even go into the all the plot holes and no sense paradoxes as i'm sure many have already done but what a sad ending to a wonderful journey? and please Disney, please lay off on the Wokey preaching crap its getting tedious, lets just have a good story eh and leave the politics to the Politicians?"
1680,"Jul 31, 2024",10,"Infinity War went to show the amazing cinematic achievement that the MCU has reached. Avengers: Endgame is the pinnacle of that. I'm usually not one for three-hour movies, but this one is a blast. It was and always will be a blast of a film. If I need a longer escape, Avengers: Endgame is there. I could watch the final hour any day during the week! It was just such an epic movie!What was great about Infinity War was that it took all these different plot lines and put them together into just two beautifully. Avengers: Endgame is a different case. They took this big giant group, and then split them into three. Then they all came together at the end. The moment they all come together in the portals, has to be one of the most iconic scenes in movie history.So, with them splitting into some beautifully crafted plot lines, they then go on to close them. Absolutely beautiful! From the first time I watched this to now, I tear up at those different closers. All of these characters' performances were spectacular! From Thanos, to Hulk, to Hawkeye, to Black Widow, to Rocket, to Thor, to Captain America, then Iron Man."
1681,"May 3, 2019",9,Perfect ending for the mcu brought all 22 films together
1682,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"Wow .. ok the story is straight forward ,yes sometimes too much to process and if u think about it you might find flows but the main thing that made that movie great is just how easily it makes you fell every emotion the scene wants you to feel , you want to cry you will cry or at least feel terribly sad u want to laugh , be exited you will 100% . Also the amount of references is a a lot . Honestly I don't think they (MCU) can top that at least on the emotional scale ."
1683,"Dec 6, 2021",8,"My favourite movie of all time. I love every minute of it and I'll be rewatching it many times in my life. The movie brings the franchise back down to some of it's core members to really delve into their unique perspectives on the events of the past film. It gives many of the characters very satisfying endings to their arks, and sets up other characters really well to carry on their legacy.If you've not seen a marvel movie before, I highly recommend catching up with the other ones first, but this is a must see for everyone."
1684,"Apr 26, 2019",7,"Not sure why people rated so high for this pure entertaining hero movie. To me, a non-fan, it's still far from something called EPIC."
1685,"May 2, 2019",10,"Now I am going to put it out there that although I gave this a 10/10 it was not perfect. I enjoyed Infinity War more also. It was a great movie though, a true event and a worthy and somewhat emotional end to an epic saga. Yes, I know there will be other Marvel movies and who knows some of the old guard may return but it did kind of feel like a befitting end to many of the original characters. Thor and the Guardians were super fun, Hulk was the best he has been, Cap was truly stoic, for once I actually liked Hawkeye and Ant-Man was a laugh a minute. The plot made sense and although far fetched, who cares, most comics and superhero movies are. The action sequences were awesome also. My only gripe was that there was probably not enough action. The first couple of hours was bringing everyone together and giving us and many of the characters a chance to reminisce and feel the nostalgia. It really was at times moving and emotional especially Cap and Stark and their back stories. Then there was the final battle which was epic and moving end. Some characters cane full circle, some found happiness and some didn't and there was a set up for a few more movies and collaborations in the future. A truly great movie. I was hoping for better but at the same time was in no way disappointed. Avengers you will be missed but I have a feeling there might be more to come. The comic Avengers team have a wide and varied history and different versions of the team could keep reinventing the wheel. Will it be able to reinvent the magic, the chemistry and the love we have for this team though, I don't know. Thanks for the fun many happy memories to all involved in this franchise."
1686,"Apr 27, 2019",6,"Being a marvel fan I was very excited to watch it. This turned out to be little disappointing. Still enjoyable, but I think "" infinity war"" was way way good."
1687,"Feb 4, 2020",10,People who are telling the story was dumb and giving 1 star on imdb.I am telling there the story is best ever done by directo. There was some plot holes for another marvel year movie coming 2020 and next.So time travel story really matters what's happen in end game.Nether the story off othere super heros goes in shadow.That's why everything is connected
1688,"Feb 3, 2020",9,"With the conclusion and a massive success of Infinity War, Endgame is now more hyped than ever. But with that comes reasonable concerns. How can Endgame possibly top its prequel? What could possibly happen that will make Endgame a rollercoaster ride as Infinity War was? Well, I am happy to say, the Russos did it again. They took all our heroes on journeys we never thought we would ever see. The Russos managed to add depth and humanity to every single character ranging from heroes to villains. Adding new and interesting arcs as well as wrapping up certain arcs in such a satisfying way. Masterful movie making."
1689,"Apr 27, 2019",9,I can't believe how well they did this. My expectations were so high and yet there is nothing I would change about it. Im seriously speechless.
1690,"May 27, 2021",10,"I'm honestly shocked by the amount of negative reviews of this movie, not because some people didn't like it but the by the over the top exaggeration of their expectations of how this series should end. You'd think it was the worst movie ever made and it's no where near that, everyone is entitled to their opinion but I'm not buying the absolute disgust that many are expressing, it had to end there's no way around it but don't bash it because you were expecting something different, the good guys won, you couldn't be surprised by that could you."
1691,"May 1, 2019",10,Fitting end. Twists and turns. Best film in have seen for some tome
1692,"Apr 26, 2019",7,"For the entire first hour, I was really straining to hear the dialog. I stepped out and asked the theater manager to turn it up and ... maybe they didn't. But my sister (on the other side of the planet) said it was the same thing. Did the producers intentionally make the first hour super-quiet to get us to ""lean in"" and pay closer attention maybe?Audio problems or not, by the end, I was really confused with so many questions ... and didn't feel super-motivated to watch the whole thing again to figure out all the little plot holes that were left untidied. I guess I'll have to wait for the Honest Trailer version to come along and explain everything... :)"
1693,"Jul 21, 2019",9,No superhero fan will be disappointed with this movie!
1694,"Jan 25, 2021",1,"Disney does nothing but ruin franchises they ruined Star Wars and guardians of the galaxy and now they ruined the Avengers. Infinity wars was bad, but end game is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Make Thor a drunk the hulk is not only weak but a wimp. And Captain Marvel is just the end all be all. I'm done with Disney permanently I would give end game zero stars if I could."
1695,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Every marvel movie in the history gives us the best feeling as a fan since the beginning. There are times that it will give you sadness and happiness. But, being a marvel fan changes every aspect and perspective of one's life. It gives inspiration and motivation to the people who needs it and to those people who's strugging in life.AVENGERS: ENDGAME - A final masterpiece to all marvel fans. It will give you mixed emotions, sadness, happiness then go back to sadness then happiness again and sadness. It's like a rollercoaster ride watching this epic conclusion. I don't really know what to say, i just felt SPEECHLESS after watching it. I cried for like 5 times in the cinemas and at home. I really can't get over it, just wanted to cry the whole time. I love everything about this film and it surpass all of my expectations and it is SOLID, EPIC AND A MASTERPIECE. No doubt, this is a movie of the year and the best movie of our history. Also, i am planning on watching it again because it's worth everytime and every moment of your life so i'm highly recommending it to everyone not just to all marvel fans, but to those people who wants to experience the best cinematic moment. Lastly, ENDGAME is EVERYTHING no dull moments, it is epic and solid, i have no doubt just love everything. Plus the cast and characters are the BEST, I REALLY LOVE THEM SO MUCH. THANK YOU AVENGERS! THANK YOU TO THE DIRECTORS AND TO ALL THE STAFFS! THANK YOU MARVEL FOR THIS EPIC AND SOLID MOMENT TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. YOU ARE ALL ALWAYS IN MY HEART FOREVER AND EVER. ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU!"
1696,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Great movie got everything movie needs and it very entertaining.
1697,"Sep 16, 2019",9,Awesome background score with a emotional end to the avengers....... Iron Man & Captain America will be missed.... awaiting for further movies... Stan lee.... infinity war was better then end game.... the best part of end game was captain america with thors hammer..... that scene got me goosebumps
1698,"Apr 27, 2019",8,"To incredible fanfare and hype, ""Avengers: Endgame"" has arrived. I am happy to say that the film most definitely lives up to expectations, and offers audiences a thrilling, emotionally stirring, and incredibly satisfying finale to the Avengers saga. While it's not completely perfect, it's undoubtedly a great film and far superior to last year's ""Avengers: Infinity War."" While I know that many people loved ""Infinity War,"" I dissented from them due to the excess of ""filler"" in the narrative that made the film seem simultaneously overstuffed and not completely satisfying--with the exception of the film's ending, which was one of the biggest cliffhangers in modern film history.The film picks up as the stakes from the shocking ending of ""Infinity War"" are a clear reality. and the Avengers must figure out how to defeat Thanos. I'm not going to say much else regarding the plot, but what I will say is that the film's emotional core relative to other comic book films is what truly elevates it. The action scenes are no longer just entertaining action scenes, but battles with real characters that audiences truly care about and have gone on a journey with for many films and many years now. This emotional core is enhanced by the film's score and cinematography, which are both generally understated yet also beautifully impactful at the same time. The film is consistently entertaining and paced incredibly well, and never drags despite its 181-minute runtime. There are plenty of twists and turns that even many serious fans probably won't be expecting, as the Russos do a great job with trying to subvert audience expectations. The performances are all great, and much of the cast has grown and changed quite a bit from their earlier days in MCU movies. This film is less action-focused than ""Infinity War,"" and that works to its benefit since so many important plot points are generally emphasized over action. Make no mistake, the action (and especially the climax) is excellent in this film when it happens. But ""Avengers: Endgame"" shows us that there is even more to Marvel films than those moments, no matter how thrilling and entertaining they may be. Despite its relatively minor flaws (some inconsistencies and fallacies in its narrative structure,) it's a truly fascinating exercise in watching all of the puzzle pieces of the MCU be put together, and it will be interesting to see where Marvel movies go from this point. 8.5/10Note: I saw this film in Dolby Cinema. The picture and sound quality were generally strong, but this was not one of the best Dolby presentations I have come across."
1699,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Just watch and enjoy the best moment in all the movies industry, I want to watch this movie again and again, 3 hours but you feel it like 3 seconds"
1700,"Apr 26, 2019",7,"Not overly great, but that's when comparing it to Infinity War. The humour was good, if a little unnecessary at times. I'm afraid I found myself looking at my watch just a little too much. That said, a solid 7."
1701,"Mar 10, 2021",1,Utter garbage. The Russo brothers & Kevin Fiege are quite literally the worst thing to happen to cinema.
1702,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame, being the conclusion to an epic adventure, had to be perfect. Every Marvel movie from the last decade has contributed in making my expectations for this one incredibly high. Heading to watch it, I was as excited as anxious, considering it might not be as good as I thought it could be. However, the Russo brothers have been able to create a masterpiece by putting together every significant element from the MCU. This movie will be remembered, not only by fans, for years to come, whether it makes you smile, laugh, or cry!Thank you Marvel"
1703,"May 16, 2020",9,"Tony said that he wanted to return to the family and accompany his family, but in the end he chose to come back, because of his responsibility and mission, because ""I am Iron Man."" The US team once missed the date with Carter, missed 70 years with Carter, and later attended Carter's funeral, personally sent his love to the road, thank the director for giving him a perfect ending. Black Widow is noble, heroic, heroic, fearless, and Iron Man are the greatest avengers. Thor and good mother say goodbye, Tony and father shake hands and make people cry. The American team made up for the biggest regrets in their lifetime; Banner and Hulk reconciled; Hawkeye reunited with his family; Black Widow has no family because the Avengers are her family ... The ending is too perfect and too tearful. The scene of the collective return of the ashes heroes of ""Reunification 3"" is magnificent and heartbreaking, and its scale has been increased by at least five times compared with ""Reunification 3"". In particular, the appearance of the ""Women's Federation"" is so amazing that it perfectly interprets the power of women. The eleven-year layout, 22 films, a successful ending in ""Reunification 4"". To borrow the words of Morgan Stark: Marvel I love you three thousand times!"
1704,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Without a doubt the best of the all the marvel movies
1705,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Amazing, 100% the best MCU movie by a country mile. Everything you want plus 1,000,000 extra amazing bits"
1706,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"The best film of this decade, every character paid off, such a icon story. Will be talked about for years"
1707,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Literally the best thing ever now I have gained my purpose in life
1708,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"If my friends want me to tell about this movie. I am gonna trhow'em with the strombreaker #DontSpoilTheEndgame. But if they ask how many tears that have fallen to the floor of the cinema, its 14,000,605 teardrops."
1709,"May 1, 2020",10,"This is a fantastic movie. Everyone must love it. This is the most Sci-fi film I have ever seen. Here, all the avengers went to past to fetch the infinity stones that were caught by thanos (in present). From the past, the avengers got the infinity stones and they came in the present to fight with thanos. In the war of thanos and avengers, at last Iron man get dies with thonos, which is the most heart breaking seen of the movie."
1710,"Apr 28, 2019",10,The MCU breaks the Record of the world's box office!
1711,"Aug 27, 2019",6,It was alright. Lots of plotholes and not much action.
1712,"Apr 28, 2019",10,This film served as an ode to 11 years of hard work as shown by the excellent callbacks via time travel. Each major character had their moments to shine. My favorite was the last 40 min fight scene which catered to what the fans wanted.
1713,"Oct 10, 2024",7,"I kept seeing everyone saying that Infinity War was better, but I have to disagree. This one was more plot focused, more character focused, and with far less quipping and silliness. I understand that that is probably why most people liked it less, but this suits my taste better.It was an 8 until the final battle, which had to bring it down a little as it was such a CG fest that didn't really feel grounded at any moment. Oh, and organising your forces based on which internal organs they have rather than what powers they possess is so stupid.But, outside that final battle, this was a really fun film."
1714,"Jul 28, 2019",10,This film is a very satisfying finale to 11 years of build up. The acting as always is amazing. The film as some great action sequences (especially the final fight). The film is able to combine the comedy that most of the other marvel universe films have and has very emotional drama. Overall Avengers:Endgame is a spectacular conclusion to the infinity saga that also has a lot of great fan service packed in to it and it does not drag even with a 3 hour runtime.
1715,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Whole family loved it. Took about 15 people. Marvel didnt disapoint.
1716,"May 16, 2020",9,"The last time he met, he knew she was staying in the past, she knew he came from the future. ""Everyone can't be the ideal self,"" she told him. ""It's up to a person or a hero to see if they succeed in being themselves."" They did it, enough. The building of the gods has collapsed and the body has become empty. Since we are different, let's say goodbye. Just because we know life and death, we no longer fear life and death; just because we look down on life and death, we can calmly die; because we love life here, we are still afraid of death; because I know you know I will die, so I dare to love you 3000 times."
1717,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Worth watching.. an emotional journey with lots of memories.. marvel's best movie ever..
1718,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"A great way to close a chapter of the MCU. From beginning to end, was amazing and emotional. Three hours never went by so fast"
1719,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Not the best movie in the universe. Not adrenaline rush kinda movie. But it is the best ending, the best closure and most satisfying of all time. Got all we need got all the answer. Full range of emotions. This is the PERFECT ENDING FOR Avengers Era."
1720,"May 1, 2019",9,Specially like scarlett johansson acting in this endgame. Can feel her sadness and helpness.
1721,"May 28, 2019",10,"Perfect culmination of 11 years of 22 movies in a truly epic movie universe - MCU. After success of Infinity War expetactions for Endgame were very high and there wasn't surprise factor and Marvel srudios managed to pull it out. After IW there were million of questions in the air and this movie answered it all. We all can't get what we want from the ending (for example GoT finale) but for Endgame this wasn't the ending we need but the one we deserve. Every character got enough screen time, expect for Captain Marvel who was hyped for much more, but for sure she had important role and Brie Larson performance before she even knew how her character should do is truly what deserves round of applause. Hulk and Thor characters recieved some backflash from fans but I am very happy to see comic adaptationa of Professor Hulk and King Thor personas. Robert Downey Jr. delivered best performance of his career. There were deep scenes, scenes that left me crying out loud in the cinema, laughing out loud etc. Comedy and tragedy were very well combined and in balance - as all thing should be. Also there were some minor moments that set up the Phase 4 for MCU. Fan service was enjoyable. CGI was amazing and final battle was deserving to be compared to th LotR battle scenes. Plot was amazingly well adjusted, some fans didn't like time travel definition i believe because they didn't understand it, but it is not very hard to understand just pay attention. Also time travel is just a fiction so they can make as many rules as they want. It is a pure 10!"
1722,"May 7, 2019",10,I was shocked. Best superhero movie I have ever seen
1723,"Apr 29, 2019",8,"This movie is a hectic and at sometimes confusing wrap up to 11 years of the Avengers. It's hard to see some of the characters that you love and have enjoyed for a decade leave the MCU. And perhaps watch the MCU end, with the PC comments coming out of marvel studios. It is heavily foreshadowed in the movie and honestly I have no interest in what's coming. However, me and my family thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Although it is not as good as Infinity War. Infinity war set the bar with story, pacing, action, and a cliffhanger that made you want to see endgame so bad that some people even went out to see that very average Captain Marvel movie. The best part about it was that they didn't let Captain Marvel ruin the movie. They let some things into this movie that 10 years ago they would never have. However, since it's the end I won't gripe about that. Good movie, it doesn't need any recommendations because everybody's going to see it. I enjoyed it."
1724,"Apr 24, 2019",9,The bar was set really high with Infinity war. This movie is good but there is sth missing. I went to the cinema expecting a spectacular movie and I got a good watch nothing that would be up to my expectations. And I believe many of us who have seen the movie are disappointed.
1725,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Initial thoughts are that I'm speechless. The Russo brothers delivered in the most beautiful amazing way. There is no word to describe this movie.
1726,"Apr 27, 2019",6,"I enjoyed the movie, but it was disappointing. I expected more. The movie was very predictable. But the ""Avengers: Infinity War"" was better though."
1727,"May 28, 2019",10,"After watching all the previous movies related to this one, I was excited to see this one. The crazy ending of Infinity War left me moody and waiting for answers.Endgame is funny, sad and major! I laughed so much watching this and shred some tears. If you have seen previous movies you can totally get all the jokes and winks toward us Marvel fans :)Worth to watch at least three times! I seriously can not get over this movie!"
1728,"Apr 29, 2019",7,Doesn't measure up to Infinity wars and has too many plot holes. is not that bad but i was expecting way more than what we got is like many promises were broken on this one.
1729,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Beautiful Movie 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼But i had hope There introducing new Charchterer but not.I hope Phase 4 Will also be a good phase
1730,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This movie was everything. Many people don't understand when you're invested into fictitious characters so much but the writers clearly do. They wrote the characters in such a human way it's amazing. Even the godly characters suddenly felt vulnerable. In all honesty, I cried like a b*tch I mean waileddd. Numerous trolls popped up in the internet and declared their hate of the movie but they're obviously trying to seek other people's attention and have that one minute fame thing. But after every negative comment I want you to think of this: this movie took character development to a whole new level, it took shock factor to a whole new level. It's been hours since I watched this movie yet I am still in shock and tears. The fact that a film can have this much effect on someone is crazy ,yet, it does. This is because the way they portrayed the characters is so phenomenal that one can't help but completely fall in love with them. If you are like me and you love these characters then I suggest you take a box of tissues with you. I have never been this saddened by a movie scene."
1731,"May 5, 2019",10,"I have stayed away from the internet so that I didn't get to find out any of the storyline and spoil watching the film. This film had a tough act to follow but overall I think it did. My only criticism is that it maybe tried to be too funny at times, Infinity war was a much darker film. You can't please everyone and some of the really low ratings and bad reviews on here are ridiculous, some people need to get a grip. Overall this is a great film, full of twists, action, surprises, emotion and humour. Judge for yourselves! If this truly is the end of the road for some of the main characters I'm curious as to the focus of future Marvel films."
1732,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"OMG Guys ! This was the best Directed, edited and everything in a marvel movie ever. I love how they play with our emotions one moment you are sad and the next one you are laughing. In addition, they gave every character the perfect screen time ! I Must say that everyone should see this MASTERPIECE On IMAX to see the beauty of it."
1733,"Sep 28, 2019",10,"Thanos thought he won't be defeated, his love for power made him lose, and all glory went to the Avengers, this is the greatest movie of all time."
1734,"May 5, 2019",10,"Incredible, one of the best films I have ever seen."
1735,"Apr 30, 2019",7,"Just ordinary, nothing special from this movie with almost 3 hours duration"
1736,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"People might say that the film disappointing and the action scenes were limited, etc from the reviews i've read. the thing is, this movie is really one of the most emotional marvel movies i've ever seen. it's about family, friendship, love, sacrifice, and etc. you definitely have to watch it, because everything you've seen in the past 10 years will lead and be here and you sure don't want to miss it as a marvel fan. also prepare your tissue because there were a lot of minor scenes that even touching."
1737,"Apr 29, 2019",6,"Practically nothing happens in the first 90 minutes, then it eventually speeds up. Usual overly long battle scenes, sone sad moments and enough laughs to keep you interested. Can see more spin offs coming at some stage to keep the money rolling in."
1738,"May 7, 2019",4,"I think Thor said it best in the previous film=""This is farewell and good luck, morons."""
1739,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Seeing a movie like this was an awesome experience. Avengers: Endgame, had all, comic moments, dramatic moments, painful moments, battle, personification of love for humanity, heroism and finally JUSTICE and happy ending. This film was the end of a glorious era in world cinematography."
1740,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Actually liked infinity war better but I find this movie awsome .
1741,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"It is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. Every character gets the same quantity of attention. It was a beautiful way to end the Avengers series (I think this is the last Avengers movie, but hope that it isn't). C'MON GUYS LETS GIVE THIS MOVIE A 10/10 RATING!!"
1742,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Marvel gave us the best end to the infinty war now in end:game i could not say its the best movie no it is the most interesting or amazing movie of marvel I've ever seen sorry avatar avengers winsWhat ever it takes
1743,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"There aren't many words to describe how this film made me feel, but it definitely was the perfect ending for the Infinity Saga and it makes me incredibly excited for what is yet to come."
1744,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"OK I know there's a lot of hype for this movie but when you look past the fact that we've all been super excited because we've been waiting for a long time and you stop to think about what you just watched, there's a whole bunch of things that don't make sense. The effects are insane the movie itself is beautiful but I really hate the storyline and how they decided to go with it."
1745,"Nov 3, 2021",9,"Starting off, I would say that it is rewatchable as well as memorable.True if you watch the movie there are a few plot hole - cause there's time travel in it - but the projects of marvel coming on will surely clear that out.This could be.. I mean, This is one of the best superhero movies ever made!"
1746,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Wow what a ending. We knew this was gonna be good bye for a few of our favorite heros but what a way to say bye. You won't even notice the length of the movie, the story keeps rolling and even the slow moments are good. Will definitely see this again and highly recommend this incase you were thinking of not going."
1747,"Apr 27, 2019",10,A well made collaboration of masters pieces which turn out to be an extraordinarly Marvellous Masterpiece movie of all time . Thank you Russo brothers ....
1748,"May 3, 2019",10,The movie is One of the best movies that I ever watched it was to emotional and too exiting f... I cried 3 times at it the twist was very good and a very amazing directors and for real thank you Russo brothers and thank you Stan Lee for this masterpiece and may you rest in peace Stan
1749,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This was the end game. Beautiful, emotional, loving, lots of action, I cried, I'm sad but satisfied and super happy ❤❤❤ I dont have words to explain, well I cant explane words or no words.You just have to watch it!You'll see for yourself It's worth it and I maybe will go 2 more times to the theatre so much did I like it. Please give them Emmy awards!"
1750,"May 5, 2019",8,"This movie coud be shorter on some parts at a begining and give us more of these awsome fight scenes. At first i was woried that it could be boring, but after some time to me it was realy great!! And ended so much beter than i expected!! I loved it :)"
1751,"Apr 27, 2019",8,"Avengers: Endgame is the fourth Avengers film and the newest film from the Marvel film series. The film is directed by the Russo brothers, who also directed the previous Avengers film Avengers: Infinity War.After the actions of Thanos (Josh Brolin) from the previous Avengers movie, the remaining Avengers have to deal with the consequences of their loss. Still, the Avengers must eventually look for a way to defeat Thanos and see if there is a way to undo his dark actions.With this fourth Avengers film, the Russo brothers and scriptwriters were able to put a nice end to the eleven-year series of 22 films. The Russo brothers have also done their best to fill the film further with things that Marvel fans would like to see or they provide answers to some unanswered questions from previous Marvel films. For most Marvel fans this film can come across as a satisfactory ending. Although this film comes across as the end of the series, they have left enough free space for the next phase of the Marvel film series. They have already planned some new films and TV series for the future. Although they have these new plans, these new films will probably no longer be able to reach the same level as they did with Avengers Endgame and the eleven-year build-up to this film. Despite these future plans, they do not give anything away for the next phase of Marvel. This Marvel film, for example, has no extra scenes that still appear in the film during or after the credits. In this way, when the film is over and the lights in the room turn on again, you can actually leave the room. The only reason to remain seated during the credits is if you may want to know the names of people who have worked on certain things in the film.The atmosphere and tempo of Endgame are also different compared to Infinity War, because In Infinity War there were more action scenes and intense events that they managed to play at a relatively fast pace, but still had enough room for humorous moments. In Endgame they have a more dramatic atmosphere after losing to Thanos. The pace can also seem a bit slower, because they are mainly busy processing their loss at the beginning of the film, but also planning what they can do best now.The effects in the film also look good and credible. This way they know how to convey or bring certain things in this film in fun and creative ways. They must have used a lot of CGI and a green screen for these effects, but this is hardly reflected in the film.The acting work is also done well. Many actors and actresses can be seen in this film in their famous roles. Most of the remaining Avenger characters are also in different locations or in a different life status than we are used to. In this way, the actors who play these roles have also had the opportunity to present their known roles in a different way. In this film every hero gets his own personal moment to shine. They know for example Captain Marvel, who in her own film was not received equally positively by everyone, in a somewhat better way."
1752,"Jul 21, 2021",4,"More commercial film. The film did not output well. It could not work very well. It is mostly a film that has its own special audience. The whole movie could have been better. If there were no important actors in the film, I would give it a score of 2, but I gave the film a score of 4 because of the presence of lovely characters in the film."
1753,"Feb 3, 2020",10,This film was incredible. I was left on my seat the whole time and there is something about having an all-star cast on a film that really amps up each scene. Awesome movie with powerful values.
1754,"Apr 27, 2019",10,....after The dark knight The dark knight is the best ever. Endgame is a pretender
1755,"May 14, 2019",10,"This was a well thought out, superb conclusion for the culmination of 22 movies in 10 years. It is without a doubt the spectacle of of the decade. The movie obviously deals out tons of fans service, but is still one of the best super hero movies to ever be created."
1756,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Pride of MARVEL ... thanks you Russo brothers for such great MCU ending, brilliant events and twist"
1757,"Sep 13, 2019",10,This was amazing don't think they'll make a film like this ever again I cried laughed all the way Avengers........ Assemble 🤙
1758,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This has to be the best movie of all times. I watched it with my friend and We enjoyed the movie so much. There was hype we were jumping and screaming and cheering. The storyline is perfect the acting is outstanding the direction and cinematography script everything is perfect. Respect to all those who work hard on this movie. No doubt the best movie of all time. We already watched the movie 3 times now. Some people move on but not us we going to watch it tongiht again. Whatever it takes, Whatever it takes."
1759,"Feb 8, 2020",6,"This was eye candy and fan service at its finest but then again, that's what the general audience wants"
1760,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"This will go down as one of the greatest comic book films in history. It's a true blockbuster achievement. The reason I love the MCU is not because of action, it's not because of the visuals, it's because of the characters. I love these characters and truly relate to some of them on a deep personal level. I saw Iron Man when I was 11 years old and Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark has literally been a part of my childhood since that movie. And Marvel has done a really wonderful job building these characters and crafting their stories because this movie was a phenomenal ending. Sure it hasn't always been perfect but I really don't see how you could have ended it any better with the way they crafted their story. It all felt right and made sense. The 3 hours never stalled for me because I was just really invested in what everyone was feeling and thinking. Call me a baby but I teared up every 10 minutes because of a piece of dialogue or emotion a character delivered because it was so in line with what they've been through. By the end, I was bawling even when the credits were still rolling. On a more critical side of things this movie won't be something you can pick up any day and watch on video. Infinity War definitely benefits more from the action and pacing side of things and it's a lot easier to watch because of how fast everything moves. But this is required so much emotional investment that when you throw it on then you know you gotta clear your schedule. There's so much movie in this movie it's hard to really just sit down and not get up during it. There's no room for bathroom breaks unless you really don't care that much lol. So will everyone love this? No. But if you put alot of time and investment into these characters and these movies, and you care about their struggles and the things they've been through, you'll find some emotional pay off in this movie I promise. Cap is my favorite Avenger and I was completely satisfied with his arc in these movies. Much like Infinity War this movie is an experience and one you'll remember hopefully. I'm seeing this again as soon as possible and I would just like to thank Marvel for being a home for my childhood at the movies. I love Star Wars but I never got to experience the original trilogy in theaters. That movie magic and impact was displayed for me in the MCU. This was my Star Wars. Thank you Marvel thank you. 10/10."
1761,"May 6, 2019",1,"No Spoilers This movie epitomises why I no longer pay to go to the cinema. It must be a free ticket and I must be bored. Those are my two criteria. It is therefore quite ironic that this film is boring. Was I not clear in my criteria. I said ""I must be bored"". NOT I want to see a BORING film! I quite enjoyed Infinity Wars to some extent but this film was just plain stupid. It must have been written by the children of the directors. It's that bad. I tried to tolerate this film as much as possible, started falling asleep then pinched myself and thought, ""what tf am I doing here?"" and walked out!"
1762,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Never have I ever left a movie theatre feeling like this, and I can't seem to shake it off me. You can't prepare yourself, even if you think you know what is going to happen next. Never heard a theatre full of Finns crying."
1763,"May 3, 2019",10,Spectacular film. Spectacular performances. Not just a great superhero movie but a great movie all round. The Russo's smashed it.
1764,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"If you've been following Marcel cinematic universe for more than 5 years, this movie will probably become your favorite movie, it potentially can be one of the greatest movies of all times , so give your reviews !"
1765,"Apr 28, 2019",10,This movie is amazing. Great culmination of every inch of the previous MCU movies. Will watch multiple times in theaters and own as soon as it becomes available.
1766,"Apr 27, 2019",10,I aint going to spoil the movie but it was awesome it was worth the 3 hours
1767,"May 2, 2019",6,"Not saying what happened but 3 hours are way too long. There could be easily 30 minutes cut due to long scenes and plot discovery.Lots of people had to""hit the head"" because of the long scenes.Just saying"
1768,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"After 21 movies in the MCU, Endgame manages to not only bring a satisfying ending for this saga, but it also manages to bring up a coherent story full of intense and emotional moments, and a wonderful third act final battle that blows my mind. Despite having an ambitious plot overall, the Russo Brothers created an espectacular movie where everyone in the general audience can enjoy."
1769,"May 3, 2019",1,"Completely shocked at how bad this is. Thought marvel did a great job with infinity war, with character development and tying the story all together.Endgame is the exact opposite. Back to the cliche terrible jokes, no character development. Focus on the worst actors, almost no screen time for all the most talented members of the new marvel cast.Back to the drawing board required for next avengers movie.Genuinely awful film!! So disappointed."
1770,"May 12, 2019",9,"I love this movie not just because there are fan service moments, but the writing is woven together from previous Marvel films and this phase of the MCU culminates in grand style. The fan moments are justified then, because of the writing and the story offers balance. There is no shortage of humor, as you would expect; It has become a stapel to have in a Marvel movie. I can connect with the characters (protaganists) who after losing to Thanos in Infinty War must accept that defeat and move on with that sour taste still in their mouths. This is something most of us have more than likely had to deal with at one point or another in their lives: Defeat and how to pick ourselves up after losing. People can say what they want about the different issues and ""plotholes"" but honestly, ""Avengers Endgame"" closes out this phase in the MCU in such an epic way.. It'll be interesting to see how they should attempt to top this!"
1771,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Endgame is the best superhero movie ever made. It reaches you in ways that you can't even imagine. It will make you laugh, it'll make you cry. It will make you experience a wide range of emotions without deflecting from the original storyline. With stunner starcast and their amazing performances, you'll definitely be spellbound."
1772,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I watched this yesterday afternoon (27th April) and the following morning i still can't believe the events that unfolded! You contemplate every scene you've watched, still with raw emotion with shock and awePerfect end to a Saga they have been building for 11 years Sad its over but satisfied at the same timePure Genius!"
1773,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Just perfection, in every detail. Could not have been more satisfied"
1774,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"This movie hit all the notes, was well acted, entertaining, emotional and wrapped everything up nicely. Yea the time travel aspect is hokey but ITS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE PEOPLE! Don't believe the hate, do believe the hype and go see this movie!"
1775,"Nov 12, 2021",8,"I mean, is this not one of the greatest movies of all time? A sheer feat in filmmaking as well. How does one get all that cast in one movie? Only the Russo brothers can pull this off."
1776,"Feb 18, 2020",10,"This was a phenomenol and perfectly executed picture to wrap up a final conclusion to a deserving saga. I could honestly not be anymore happier with the outcomes of this film. It was thoroughly well-scripted throughout the movie with acheiveing to seperate the humour, action and emotions equally. The Russo Brothers nailed the directing and the actors and actresses executed their roles outstandingly. Visuals were cunning all the way. Character developments and sadly send-offs were perfectly done. But most importantly it had its unforgettable moments which stood out and ended this masterpiece."
1777,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Simply is the greatest super hero movie there is. I really don't want to get into the movie to avoid spoiler's
1778,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Beautiful everything, watch it. Its speak better for it selves than any critic can ever do"
1779,"Apr 28, 2019",10,It's even better Than Last year Infinity War Age Of Ultron was ok and the first Avengers Movie Greet. Endgame was the Greatest Superhero In history
1780,"Apr 25, 2019",9,"Up there with the best film I've seen, perfectly ended an 11 year journey, blown away."
1781,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Well, let's say it changed my life! This movie is the best movie ever made!"
1782,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Not just a superhero movie It pulls you in and makes you feel like your the superhero just amazing
1783,"May 12, 2019",10,I am so emotional watching the last movie of ironman. This movie is awesome. I am happy to being part of the marvel universe.
1784,"Sep 21, 2019",6,"Maybe it's better to see Infinity War (2018) because it do picks up what is left of that particular flick. Clocking in over 3 hours it was for me way too long to watch.Maybe no-one will understand me but 3 hours it has to be good. And it do has it moments building up to the fight towards the last part of this flick but it also has a lot of boring moments and moments were they are talking too much.I's towards the last half hour that it really becomes what you're waiting for, the endgame. As said, it's not all that bad but the irritating conversations of Tony Stark made me yawn a lot and even reach for the remote control.Nice to see that Spiderman is involved sadly we do know by now that it could be a once in your lifetime experience. DC and Marvel coming together, not for Disney anymore. Money makes the world goes around. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5"
1785,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Ignore those bad and good reviews ! Just buy the ticket and go watch it for yourself ! I guarantee it would worth 3 hours of your life !
1786,"Apr 29, 2019",4,"Fanboys are ruining the movie industry. 9,1? Really? This movie is far from the best movie of all times. It's insane and sad. Disney is cancer."
1787,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I don't have a lot to say but this was amazing work. The combination of all the great Marvel movies in the past 11 years to get this. Also so many references and jokes that were really funny especially if you know the movies well.
1788,"Apr 30, 2019",9,"Deus ex machina? No Deus ex capt. Marvela! I audibly groaned at the A-Force shot because it made no sense in the context of the film, and it's pandering to a tiny minority of the community that mocks these types of movies anyway. It's not just male characters that were trivialized by Miss Marvel. All the organic female heroines were also pacified by Captain Marvel, most of all, Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch. Brie Larson is the toxic element that has contaminated the MCU. She literally ruined exery scene she was in. She is a repulsive human and a horrible ACTRESS! Remove her and get #IdentityPolitics out of the MCU!"
1789,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"After the masterpiece that was infinity war, I did not think they could top it, I was very wrong. This film does everything right, from the action to the comedy, the emotion and above all, to the fan service. This is everything I could have hoped for from the movie and I will definitely be re-watching it. A true masterpiece"
1790,"May 4, 2019",10,Best movie ever!! I cried the whole movie!! Two thumbs up!!
1791,"Apr 25, 2019",6,"Less action, too many drama, and not all heroes in super hero modes, no twisted ending .. little boring."
1792,"May 3, 2019",7,"After 'the vanishing' in Infinity War, there were still a handful of superheroes left knocking about to try and restore order to the universe, but in Endgame the real hero is a rat. A lowly rodent scampers across the controls of Hank Pym's quantum machine, activating a few switches with his little ratty feet, bringing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) back from his five-year stay in the quantum realm. And it is Lang's return that kick-starts a desperate attempt to reverse Thanos' nefarious handiwork.If you can swallow such lazy writing, then you'll no doubt have no problem with the rest of the film, which resorts to that old chestnut - time travel - with all the paradoxical problems that arise as a result. Unfortunately, I struggle to let such things slide, annoyed by rather casual approach taken by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, whose script scampers lightly over the temporal issues like a rat over a console (I'm sorry, I just can't let that go). While the film is undeniably enjoyable as a slam bang piece of mega-budget entertainment, it isn't as flawless or as clever a denouement that one might hope for.Visually, Endgame is hard to beat and it's great to see all of the A-list stars of the past MCU movies coming together for one last effects-filled battle (it's amazing what $400,000,000 can buy), but for the culmination of a twenty-two film series, I had dearly hoped for something a bit more considered and fulfilling than a great-looking movie that is ultimately dependent on the actions of a rat (yes, it irritated me THAT much...)."
1793,"Jul 30, 2019",3,What was that. A fat useless thor. Bits of old stuff. An ant. A stupid looking not the hulk.. I give up. That was awful.. All hype. 3 hours of my life I can't get back... You wait it will dawn on you... This was just a bad film.
1794,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I see it and It's really one of the best marvel movies it's an epic literally crowned to be best end of a long superheros series and satisfied ending
1795,"Sep 23, 2019",9,"Like I said when I reviewed the last film, Infinity War, the Avengers seem to get better with each film (and longer it seems). The Russo brothers have become great storytellers over the last few years, and have been great at keeping the story secret. This film is the culmination of more than twenty films over the past eleven years, and it is extremely epic!There are some twists and turns in this film that you might not see coming, but are essential to the Avengers story-line. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll love this chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I definitely see this film up for multiple Academy Awards in 2020, maybe even Best Picture; its that good."
1796,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"A Beautiful Movie having The most Satisfying Conclusion. True Fans will never forget this, as this one is made especially for them."
1797,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"The connections that we have made with these characters all these years comes full circle in this movie and it is pulled off in an incredible, emotional, epic finale"
1798,"Apr 1, 2020",10,The best movie I ever watched. no words to tell.Pls rate 10 of 10
1799,"Apr 24, 2019",7,The pacing in this movie is flawed. The humour is forced. But this finale is fitting and satisfying
1800,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"Avengers Endgame was heart wrenchingly awesome yet very fitting, thanks to Marvel Studios for the last 10 years of fantastic films. A fitting End to 10 years of the MCU Universe."
1801,"Apr 24, 2019",7,"Thank you-Marvel for giving me this epic movie,and beautiful memories,but I'm still crying and I'm done with you. Thank you all those years,and I'll always remember how you break my heart. And you are destroy everything you built in the past ten years. You destroy a little girl's dream that she got her first comic book at 12 years old. Yeah it's a good movie but the worst story."
1802,"May 1, 2019",1,"Really disappointed after watching it yesterday. Unnecessarily long, very boring finish to a series of movies with a lot of peaks (Ragnarock, GotG, CaptA) and quite a few troughs (AoU, Iron Man generally, Black Panther) but I thought this was a new low. Really poor writing, idiotic plot holes and stupid action scenes. Really sad end.. felt like flogging a dead horse, shame to go out like this."
1803,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Best series i have ever seen with a perfect ending. 3000 love for average film.
1804,"Apr 29, 2019",10,This is the greatest movie I' ever watched!! Amazing work!!🔥🔥👌🏻🎞🙏🏻
1805,"May 1, 2019",10,"Before walking into the theater I thought of a dozen different ways this movie could possibly play out, but it was none of those. It progresses in a make-sense but surprising fashion that I've never seen in any other movies. Not to say it doesn't have plot holes, but I happily embrace it because I honest believe no one could've done a better job in writing the story. Great job Marvel and thank you for pulling this off!"
1806,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame takes place after the grave events of Avengers: Infinity War(2018). The world is in shambles, after Thanos(Josh Brolin) succeeds with his nefarious plan. All the remaining Avengers reunite to stop Thanos, no matter what the consequences.Avengers: Endgame is a mind-blowing film. Directors Anthony Russo & Joe Russo have given us an absolutely satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga, which consists of all 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies which have released, so far. The emotional moments make you shed a tear or two. Don't worry though. The comedic moments are aplenty, as well. The effortless chemistry & the banter among all the Avengers, remains intact. The action set pieces are glorious. The climactic set piece is the highlight of the film. You will cheer till you no longer can, as so many moments will bring you pure & unadulterated joy! The visual effects are brilliant. The 3D is eye-popping. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is incredible as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is unforgettable as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is superb as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Don Cheadle is effective as James Rhodes/War Machine. Paul Rudd is amazing as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Brie Larson is awesome as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Karen Gillan is awe-inspiring as Nebula. Danai Gurira is impressive as Okoye. Bradley Cooper is hysterical as Rocket. Josh Brolin is flawless as Thanos. The supporting cast is scene-stealing in their respective roles. Avengers: Endgame is a must watch. Go & experience this action-packed, hilarious, emotional & wholesomely entertaining rollercoaster ride of a film. My all-time favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie & the best superhero film, of all time. Absolutely jaw-dropping stuff!"
1807,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"It may have just been the high expectations set by the reviews, but this movie is not as good as the internet is making it out to be. Infinity War, in my opinion, was a much much stronger film overall. This was very poorly paced, had some really bad attempts of humour, and a lot of unnecessary scenes. The actual plot was quite good and kept me engaged, but the execution was lacking. Don't go into the cinema with high expectations because you may be disappointed."
1808,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"A beautiful ending to a legendary story. No spoilers from me, a must watch. 100,000,000/10"
1809,"May 5, 2019",1,3 hours about nothing. Only one reason why this movie has too large box office is hyping.
1810,"Jun 4, 2019",10,I love it the bast avengers movie of all the times
1811,"Aug 17, 2019",10,"I think film is entering a post-cliche phase, where tired tropes are no longer tired, but are now just accepted tools in a storyteller's toolbox. Certainly we don't need to enforce originality on all forms of art. I adore this film. The entire MCU is a breathtaking opera, and this is the ten-year grand finale. You *do* need to see all twenty-one previous films (in chronological order, hopefully, rather than release order) because taken on its own, ""Endgame"" would be a mishmash, with so many of its call-backs missed.I think film is also leaving the era of the auteur, and entering that of the committee. George Lucas may have been the final straw, as when Disney (the originators of the committee method, from what I can tell) picked up the mantle of that particular franchise, their natural choice to revert to committee decisions dovetailed with everyone's need to get franchises out of one person's control. The MCU was planned out ten years in advance, so that almost at once -- and certainly by Ultron -- ""Endgame"" was being envisioned. Seeing how all the disparate threads meet and find either their resolution or their own inspiring arc, that *in itself* is amazing. Knowing that, in the most crucial moment of the film, we get a familiar call-back to a much earlier part of the MCU, elevates the experience from one of possible bewilderment to outright joy. It's no wonder that other directors would defer this type of blockbuster to the Russos. I only wonder how anyone involved in the creative process could have kept these secrets to themselves for ten years. Knowing that this film makes its predecessor seem like a prelude, and all the other significant milestones in the franchise series seem like blips on a radar, it must have been nerve-wracking to know how all of this turns out and still feed us those ""massive"" revelations in the earlier films.When in the right context, a superlative experience. As good a film experience as you will find. Yes, if you don't gel with the film, it could strike you any number of odd ways, but most people are on board with it being a new classic."
1812,"Feb 18, 2021",9,"Avengers Endgame is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, existing to reward the fans love, patience, and undying adoration. Endgame has a difficolt job and did it very well. It's epic and allows space for one of the best performances from Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evan. However this movie has something less than Infinity War. The entire time I was watching Infinity War I was on the edge of my seat, afraid for every character's life, but not during all the running time of Endgame. Nevertheless Endgame has more epic moments and it is such a perfect end of the Avengers that it's hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed.Rating: 9,3."
1813,"Aug 4, 2019",9,Truly epic and incredible experience worth every penny
1814,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This movie was soo epic. You're not ready for this movie and therefore the epic conclusion of more than 10 years. Tears will be shed, laughing will happen because this movie has everything. That's why it's a 10/10! See for yourself!"
1815,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"This is such an epic movie! You will get everything in this movie. Fun, emotion, love, what is not in the move! This is such a great ending! I just love this movie and cried when watching this..."
1816,"Apr 25, 2019",6,"I am going to be very unpopular her, and seem to be in the minority but this is barely an okay action film.The advertising stated Dr Strange has seen endgame 14 million time.... believe me once is enough.I loved infinity war, and it is by far the best MCU film. This is just a means to bring back characters. Yes it ends the saga but is lacking.The humour is clumsy and although a few laugh out loud moments, overall these seemed forced.It had so much potential and although filmed simultaneously with infinity war, feels like a totally separate film. It's akin to one person writing one and then someone else picking up the second, disagreeing with that story line and just making there own version by undermining what the first and the other 21 movies had achieved."
1817,"May 15, 2019",1,This guy is a horrible actor and ruins the whole experience
1818,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"The previous Avenger movies do not have a perfect plot because of it's limited time for a long story. The endgame is long enough to enjoy the rising action and twists and everything else just for the final hit, way better than all previous movies. The reason I gave 9 stars instead of 10 is because the storyline consists of fragments which were presented not perfectly but it's good. I mean it is hard to make it perfect but your mind have to be flexible and clear enough to switch between those fragments. Overall it's worth watching it."
1819,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"It is full of Hype and exciting ,a great ending, you won't regret watching it at all!"
1820,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This is definitely the pinnacle of Marvel's years of story building, so epic, so mesmerizing, so perfect. I couldn't imagine any superhero movie could be any greater than this, at least not in the foreseeable future. I don't think anybody should miss this movie. Watch it while it's still playing on theatres. This could be the greatest movie of this decade, or even any decade for that matter."
1821,"Oct 9, 2021",9,"A lot of films take you on an emotional roller coaster but for us Marvel fans, this was the creme de la creme. A masterpiece. If you nit-pick any film you'll find holes on top of holes. Continuity errors. Things that happen without reason. This movie has so many super heroes in it, the amount of logic errors are mountainous and also, who cares? We don't watch these movies to pick them apart. We watch them to escape our universe and temporarily enter theirs. This movie could have been better in many ways but it was damn near perfect with all its flaws. Reminds me of humans..."
1822,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"Even though I was able to predict the plot, this film was absolutely amazing. Incredible action, tear jerking & the perfect end to the Infinity Stone Arc. Only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was because 1 character I can't stand. Luckily they weren't in it much."
1823,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"Just watch and you will know this is a good film , MCU know how to play with your mood😂"
1824,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"The hype surrounding this film after Infinity War was unavoidable. This is the finale to a very long lead up of films and that final action scene is money well spent. Endgame doesn't have that flawless conclusion but at least it's ambitious. It is exactly how a massive ensemble cast should be filmed and it never feels one sided, it's an Avengers film. My issue with the film is more about the repeating villain and large plot holes left from the time travel. It lacks answers and leaves the clean-up to Spiderman Far From Home. I miss the times when films had to be complete and explained. Infinity War was a better film and offered more."
1825,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Except the unexpected. Expect tears, laughter, sorrow, pride and joy. It was amazing. Im still trying to recoup myself."
1826,"Apr 27, 2019",6,Unfortunately after all the hype leading up to the movie I was rather disappointed. Infinity War was always going to be tough to top but was disappointed with Endgame as it felt as a walk down memory lane. The fighting scenes were not as good and they seemed rather one sided. Also was not such a fan of how they changed certain main characters appearance - for the worse in my opinion.
1827,"May 13, 2019",2,"Terribly disappointed in the effort. There should have been something ""more"". The movie plods from scene to scene with no real tension, almost as if marvel is giving the viewer the cliff notes on the last 10 years of films. Even the end battle was snooze-worthy, including the mostly useless Captain Marvel showing up as the deus ex machina."
1828,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Best endgame for The 10 years, you won't believe your own eyes and it's surpass of all the expectation.Part of journey is the end.""I am Iron Man"" -Iron Man/Tony Stark"
1829,"Jul 14, 2021",9,Avengers endgame was part of the marvel movie franchise it was an overall amazing movie and I am very impressed with the the acting there were a few plot holes and some unanswered questions but other then that it would be a 9/10.
1830,"May 15, 2019",10,Loved it! Kept reading all the thoughts on how it might go.. was pleasent with the outcome
1831,"Sep 20, 2020",10,"The movie is spectacular. Great special effects and a couple of twists. It's a bit long (around 3 hours), but it's totally worth it. I recomend it to kids 10 to 21 years old. (I'm 12). Cool movie. Marvel has totally succeeded."
1832,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"For a series in the Marvel universe that started fairly bland, MCU's Avengers: Endgame brings out everything that makes it stand out. Characters were solid, all respected their role in the plot and not one of the dialogues between them was redundant. Plot kept its pacing, coherence and more importantly its continuation from Infinity War which is essentially Part 1 of this movie. This is one the weird movies that doesnt soely rely on its own 1hr 30 mins narrative to drive a plot, but takes privileges from the movies that came before and neatly tie everything down, its clever and well executed, i honestly wish there were more moments like this in the MCU. No spoilers so its short, this is a movie that deserve praise, 10/10 for perfect sequel."
1833,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame was made by the cast and crew of Infinity War and is the last film of Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Endgame, as the last film, offers an utterly unpredictable, ambitious and unique story that pleasurably ends the saga. The feeling of catharsis is present throughout the film. Each character has a character arc with some that isn't present in the preceding films.The visuals of the film improved from Infinity War. Some scenes offered CGI heavy scenes that almost felt like a comic book. More ""comic-bookey"" from the previous films.The tone of the film is probably the darkest of the whole MCU but still has a lot of humor sprinkled throughout, which all of them worked. The performances of the cast were the best they've ever been, giving their characters more layers than it's ever been.Endgame is a very cathartic film for old and new fans alike. With some devastating moments, it is a very emotionally satisfying film that every Marvel and movie fans need to see. The eleven years of build up and characterization has paid off in this very historic comic book movie. It is by far, the best MCU and the best comic movie we have.-Yman Dayawon"
1834,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"Kinda slow eh? Long drawn out scenes where nothing. not even music is playing. Hulk did nothing, Thor was fat the whole movie,...and The biggest flop Ms marvel did nothing and was in the movie for 6 seconds in a less than spectacular final fight scene. Other than that the movie was pretty great...just slower and not as interesting as Infinity War."
1835,"Jul 7, 2021",10,Nothing more to say. This movie was the greatest. It skittle have never been knocked off the number 1 ranking money maker.
1836,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"Okay..so spoilers be darned..THis movie was kinda very slow. Still a great movie. But can we talk about the ""Captain Marvel"" SCAM. They tricked us into thinking that Marvel played a big part in this movie. When she only has about 12 seconds of air time...12 seconds...ok that is an exaggeration...it was probably 10 seconds."
1837,"Apr 24, 2019",9,They couldn't give every hero equal billing (they tried with Antman & Captain Marvel which is the minus one star) so they made the movie all about the original Avengers from 2012 and...the movie does not disappoint. Couple of 'wow' moments with a generous sprinkling of sweet tender moments throughout. The best finale anyone can ask for and a fitting curtain call for the original Avengers. Kudos and a big THANK YOU to the Russo brothers!
1838,"Apr 29, 2019",10,I'm no reviewer of films but just my two cents! That was amazing! It was the perfect way to end a 22 film cycle that will never be done again and that is why it gets a 10 from me.
1839,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I am so lucky to live in NZ where we got to see it on 24 April and I made sure I was at first screening to avoid spoilers. If you are a Marvel fan - I promise I will keep the #Don'tSpoilTheEndGame. This is an emotional rollercoster - you will laugh (we cried of laughter at a few scenes), you will cry (so take tissues), you will hold your breathe, you will be on the edge of your seat and you will pump your fists. 3 hours fly and you will sit through the end credits trying to work out how you feel - emotionally drained but satisfied too I hope. Having watched all other movies in chronological order this month I am amazed at how this pulls all of the unknown as well as known loose strings together. If you are new to Marvel world then you must watch Avengers:Infinity Wars first or this will not make sense."
1840,"May 7, 2019",10,Amazing movie but too sad is over. Hope they make more
1841,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"For me, Avengers: Endgame is honestly the greatest, most thrilling and epic film of the MCU, the battle scenes and performances shown were never done before in Marvel cinematic history and they will leave you with so much surprises!11 years in the making and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It exceeded everyone's expectations and even the comic book nerd ones!Go see it while you can because you will NEVER ever experience something like this in a movie theatre this breath-taking and shocking.It also had such an amazing and satisfying wrap-ups to the major characters of the MCU. Couldn't ask for a better movie and a better way to end this hell-of-a journey."
1842,"Apr 27, 2019",6,"Epic opening scene follow by 90 mins of nothing special followed by 80 mins of waves of poor quality to solid quality with a epic final battle scene. So many parts that made zero sense. The more time that goes on the less sense some of the story line makes. I could go on for hours about stuff that was negative and about 15 mins of quality to be spoken of. Look, everyone will watch for themselves. Ultimately disappointing unless your a stubborn baised superfan who believes marvel can do no wrong."
1843,"May 11, 2019",1,"The worst movie in the world. the movie goes from being a superhero movie to a comic. Full of errors, ridicule and absurd situations. Horrible!"
1844,"Oct 11, 2021",10,"Avengers: Endgame is an incredible, riveting, highly entertaining and very emotional film, and a brilliant end to the Marvel's Infinity Saga. My first time viewing left me speechless and pleasantly surprised, and I had high expectations. Just like Infinity War before it, it is a masterful film that managed to meet the massive expectations of fans, delivering perfectly on story and character development in a ways I couldn't even expect.While some may think it has a slow beginning, you've come to care so much about the characters and story that it's still investing. The story is intriguing and filled with countless twists and turns that keep you hooked. Seeing each of the characters continue and close their story arcs is very satisfying and poignant, especially how they concluded the stories of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers; you could not ask for a better ending for these characters then what this movie delivers. While some seemed to have a problem with Smart Hulk, I really quite liked him and it was a satisfying conclusion to the conflict between Banner and Hulk. And what they did with Thor is a testament to how much the Russos cared more about characters then eye candy or fanservice; it is completely understandable, realistic, and human to see him devastated after everything terrible that has happened to him, crushed by his own failure, and its great when he begins to believe in himself again. The film balances its emotional scenes perfectly with its comic relief as to make a film that feels appropriately heartfelt and somber while also not forgetting to let its audience have a little fun. The huge final battle is an absolute feast for the eyes and never fails to get me giddy. It has to be one of the most astounding battles ever on film. There exist no lapses in the visual effects, the music is perfect, and acting is excellent, the entire cast gives top-tier performances.An excellent film and a perfect follow-up to Infinity War and ending to the Infinity Saga."
1845,"May 15, 2019",10,"Started dark but really brought the story together, worth the wait but now we feel empty that the series is over!"
1846,"Jun 11, 2019",10,"I've been a big fan of Marvel, for a long time. So believe me when I say, this is my favorite movie of all time. It could use some work, but hey it deserves a ten even if it should probably be a nine or eight. Watch the movie you'll enjoy it."
1847,"Aug 2, 2019",10,"Where to begin? All the callbacks and tie-ins to past MCU films are truly a celebration of the MCU. As always, the action is exciting(Although sparse) and humour cracks you up. This movie reaches a new level going into the third act, with epic moments that put a grin on your face and an ending that might just put a tear in your eye. A must watch!"
1848,"Jun 19, 2019",8,"Watching the coming attractions was depressing. No wonder kids are half brain-dead today. My only interest in anything Avengers is Benedict Cumberbatch. I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable. Special effects were amazing, but for about a half hour there I felt like I was watching a video game.Thought the script managed to have some poignancy and humor as well. And you have to see it in a theater."
1849,"Jul 30, 2019",10,"It's funny it's a great movie with great reviews and is highly successful, overall. But, the trolls are coming out to play on imdb today, boy. It tied up previous loose ends from past films, it had a good story that was inventive, fun and clever. It had many easter eggs tied to past films and movies and is a great superhero film and a good film, period.9.4/10"
1850,"Aug 2, 2019",10,"Thank you for 10 years of great entertainment! Loved all the 22 movies and can't wait to see the next 22. A great ending to a 2 part movie. All was 5 stars, ALL! Masterpieces! Will rewatch all, forever... AVENGERS!"
1851,"Aug 17, 2019",6,"Terrible ending, I can say terrible, it was scaled down to a funny story rather than a great one, worst avengers movie ever"
1852,"Apr 28, 2019",1,The movie picks storyline at its own convenience. Impossible things become possible at the noise orchestra. My biggest complain is that there is no coherence especially how do you quantity powers of these super heroes ? Just hit smash and do it all over again.
1853,"Jul 31, 2019",10,"Let's start with this, the plot has little flaws or plot holes here and there. And if you didn't watch a whole lot of other previous MCU films. Maybe this is not for you.For me, who watched every MCU movies ever produced. This one has it all. A new take on hero movie, part of it like mission impossible. Very well thought out story. A hidden layer of means. Take its time to resolve many things, not rushing it.If Ironman I is a 10, this one is a 11."
1854,"Apr 25, 2019",10,Ending of the Avenger with awesomeness but I feel little slow than other Avenger because of too emotional scenes.
1855,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"In arguably the most anticipated movie of the year and one of the most anticipated movies of all time, Avengers: Endgame was well on its way with all the hype leading up to the film. Having enjoyed Infinity War but thought it could have been better all around, the overall hype for Endgame had its match made. Now having watching this film in theaters as it was a must watch to (due to the 3D experience and also knowing the longer one waited, the more likely spoilers would have been exposed, ruining the experience and essence of the film).As a film, won't say much but this film delivers on expectations. Had no knowledge of the overall plot but within the first few minutes, one was excited and was there for the thrill of the ride throughout. With a runtime of over three hours (including end credits), the film has a great pace and doesn't feel nearly as long (which is great since something is always happening). Due to its great cast and plethora of characters, there really is never a dull moments and the film is ensured and filled with moments of surprise, suspense, action emotion and overall greatness.Now the overall plot of time travel was well done and brought back many memories to the other Avenger films. The wait for the film was most definitely worth it, and this film will most doubly become one of the biggest movies of alltime. Will need to see this film probably once more in theaters before its run is over and most definitely will see it again multiple times afterwards to soak in its greatness. Avengers: Endgame is more than a movie, it's a moment - a moment in time. Cherish every moment."
1856,"Jun 3, 2019",10,We can't say anything to this awesome work these russo brothers did the work very perfect
1857,"May 13, 2019",10,"AE is the Final battle of Infinity Saga which concluded the story of every movie since 2008. The time travel explanation was good.It felt like Inception. The ending was the most fulfilling for Iron Man and Captain America. This movie couldn't have been better. The only problem with this movie was with the dubbed version in Hindi, they made the crap out of it, it was the worst dubbing ever. Please Marvel India take this into consideration. Love you 3000"
1858,"Sep 8, 2021",7,"Is being overrated, kids love supper hero.7 for the action."
1859,"Sep 25, 2020",10,"22 years with overs 11 movies and one epic ending,the MCU Deserves it all"
1860,"Apr 27, 2019",6,"Avengers: Endgame. Overall it was... ok. The intro got off to a quicker start than I imagined, and the expected final battle was certainly fun followed by a touching denouement. Those elements (barely) justify the film, in my opinion.However, the intervening 2 hours is a tedious collection of scenes, lame jokes and awful characterizations wrapped around an extremely tired and poorly thought out plot device. Should you see it? Sure. How can you not after investing so many years in the arc? But most people I saw it with were ultimately (at least somewhat) disappointed.Worst performance in the movie is easily Mark Ruffalo who has now solidified his legacy as the absolute worst Hulk and Banner ever committed to film. Thor was also terrible, but that's been a rapid devolution since Ragnarok.Surprisingly, the movie was pretty much stolen by the stellar performance of Jeremy Renner, which should build interest in the upcoming Hawkeye series (even if it is just a vehicle to hand off the mantle). Scarlett Johansson also stepped up her game and was very impressive."
1861,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Best movie I've seen so far. I doubted of thuis movie realiteit could be better than IW, nut iT certainly is. Great movie that I would recomment to everyone!"
1862,"Sep 30, 2021",10,I WAIT 364 DAYS FOR THIS..... I GIVE THIS MOVIE 4.8./5. THIS IS NICE.
1863,"Oct 6, 2019",10,"Don't need to say anything else now, do I? A masterpiece."
1864,"Apr 27, 2019",9,This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in my entire life!! It's the best super hero movie ever!! It deserves a lot of Oscars. It's just epic!!!
1865,"Dec 19, 2019",6,"Maybe because I´m an ""over 50 year old European"" (when I look at the votes) but I don´t get it. A cast filled with big names of which have very good resumes. But this movie gives me the idea: Let´s push 1 more out ""for the team"". A team that seems to be growing with extra superheroes with every sequel.Not a movie I would watch alone, nor with my children who are 27 and 29 years of age. Maybe in 10 years time with my grandchildren but than it´s prolly outdated, like I might be atm. But these cash cow movies don´t do it for me anymore."
1866,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"Of course, Comedy with Fantasy and Action. The heroes are like your uncles and aunts, fun to watch but not what pumps your senses for the thrill. You'll feel all the time like it's meh, because they want to make all audiences enjoy the movie. Doing that the movie becomes average. So the characters are all good hearted and full of feelings, nothing like a hero who has True Will. I'm glad that at least this last movie didn't come with ideological references, it was just this polictical correctness that numbs us as society. Everyone is a good boy there. Anyway, the public that Marvel seeks now is not me. No problem, since I noticed it, I'll just ignore future movies from them. Leave a thumbs up if now you also agree it's a comedy movie not an action thriller movie, so other people can see this too."
1867,"May 19, 2019",1,"What a waste of time. I am so sorry for all the Thor & Hulk fans. I really am. Movie makers played everyone for fools with all the hype. Lord of the Rings and Avatar remains my all time favorite. My advice to all those who havent watched the movie yet, please do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD. It is highly likely that you will feel wasted like me, so at least you will have saved the money."
1868,"Apr 24, 2019",10,10/10!!! Man is gassedANTI-AVENGERS ASSEMBLEBEEN GASSED SINCE 2018 for this movie!
1869,"Apr 28, 2019",10,All characters of mcu is in this masterpiece you will fill thrilled last 8 minutes. Best movie made ever. Ty #Russobrothers #RobertDowneyJr. #Chrisevans #Stanlee #Mcu ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
1870,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"It is so difficult to express what a person that just saw the film feels. Completion, astonishment, wonder, surprise, happiness, sadness are just a few words that come to my mind at the moment that help me describe what I saw. This film has it everything! Plot twists, an amazing storyline, tributes to the past movies, humor, tears and everything you wanted this long-waited Marvel film to have. 3 is just the real number in hours for how long the film is, but in reality when it starts until it finishes, you forget that number completely by how immersive and well made this film is! This is the best film Marvel has made so far and is one unbelievable way to conclude 21 movies and 10 years worth of MCU history. Joe and Anthony Russo, Thank you!"
1871,"May 15, 2019",10,"I laughed, cried and loved every moment and act 3 is the definition of fan service, must see film, best film of the year or of all time"
1872,"May 4, 2019",7,It was slow for most of the movie. Infinity War was way better.
1873,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"What an experience that was..all those 11 years and 21 movies were leading to this one epic, satisfying and emotional conclusion..Overall the Movie is a Masterpiece...I feel very lucky that I was a part of this Universe that Marvel created.."
1874,"May 17, 2019",6,"I guess the headline wraps it up - what I feel about the movie, that is. With three hours and a rather good prequel it was expected to see some epic action and showdown between the good and evil characters, but yet we only get some minor action scenes and a heck of a lot of boring dialogues and stuff like that. Where is Superman when you need him? At least that would have made the movie more exciting for me. No, the movie has some moments, but it takes too long to get there, and when we do we only get a tiny bit of the action I was hoping for. Thus, with a rating of 8.8 and a throng og positive reviews I must say the movie was disappointingly bad, though not as bad as I first thought it would be after the first two hours though. If you like long dialogues and conversations between superheroes and fancy waiting for action through an entire movie then surely this is for you. If you're like me and liked Thor 3 best since it had a lot of action, then this will be better to watch on Netflix or something when you're out of options."
1875,"Apr 30, 2019",1,This is a good movie in terms of all its technical background but there is a lack of feel and energy throughout the film except for the scenes towards the end. You just needs to sit and wait patiently for the final battle. If you are a Marvel fan then you will enjoy it like any other Marvel films otherwise it can get sort of boring surely an overrated film.
1876,"Jan 3, 2020",10,"I'm writing this month's after it was released, months after I saw it in the theaters. I saw it opening weekend. And honestly I've never felt that way coming out of a movie before. So many emotions, all swirling in my heart and head at once. It was utterly overwhelming. My personal experience was intense but based off the reactions of the rest of that theater crowd, so was everyone else's. I like to watch a movie multiple times to see how it stands up. Watch for plot holes, inconsistencies, watch the acting again. See if things seemed forced or ingenuine. See if it brings up emotions again and again. Today I'm watching it again. Still I feel the anger, sadness, grief, excitement, and thrill! The performances are amazing (although I'm not a fan of a blended Bruce Hulk being) and the pain they go through is gut wrenching. No it's not perfect. Yes it's heavy, and the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the movie doesn't really have ""superheroes"". But that's why it's so powerful. They are broken, just like all of the universe is. They are human, struggling in an existence that doesn't make sense and they couldn't stop from happening. They miss their family and friends. The last 1/3 of the movie is the perfect way to end this story. Very well done. Compared to so many others out there lately, this one got it right."
1877,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Avengers End Game I love the movie, Absolute prefection and unbelievably epic. I was filled with extreme excitement, i laughed but cried a lot though 😢😢😿I'm never going to be ready to say Goodbye 😿"
1878,"May 8, 2019",10,"After 22 movies that slowly built up to this point, it was nicely executed, yes this one has some drama, some background on people's lives after the Thanos ordeal from the Infinity War, how people / characters changed etc etc. Has usual light heart witty jokes, the of course the Grand Finale, Watched on IMAX -3D and totally worth it. Got the tickets the first day they went on sale, Kids were counting days... Totally Worth it. Cant wait for it on Blu ray."
1879,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"You get heartwarming scenes, love scenes between characters you don't expect that aren't cheesy, character resolutions that you always wanted, and a perfect wrap up to this franchise. I was absolutely blown away. Some may say that the first half of the movie is a little slow, but without it, the movie wouldn't be complete and it shows so much love and heart between every single character."
1880,"Dec 27, 2019",10,"Masterpiece , if you are fan of superheroes then this saga ends on a big note and this is masterpiece to show-off this saga"
1881,"Apr 24, 2019",10,What an epic ending. You better go to the restroom first before entering the cinema.
1882,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"The movie is very slow not much action. all talking, all a bit boring really, NOT AS GOOD AS INFINITY WAR"
1883,"Apr 29, 2019",1,"Let me start I'm a big fan of marvel so there is no biased against them. This movie is a big pile of trash. Don't give them your hard earn cash like I did, wish I could take back 3 hours of my life. Director thinks we watch superheroes movies looking for oscar winning performances. 2hours of nonsense time travel talk, about 15min action and than more nonsense pushing agenda #metoomovement?. I thought about walking out several times.Rubbish."
1884,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Normally there are a lot of plot holes in these kind of movies (the ones HISHE delve into and make you mad later) but other than one, I honestly can't think of any. The writers do an incredible job of tying up everything into exactly what the audience has been waiting for. You will laugh cheer and definitely cry, and it's all worth it."
1885,"Jan 23, 2020",10,"Just best the end of Infinity saga for me. There is everything - comedy, drama, and an intricate plot. I can't imagine how to do better."
1886,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Just got home with my family after watching this in a packed cinema. Was a joy to watch with so many others and hear the shrieks of laughter and sobs of tears. Just goes to show what a huge part these characters have played in our lives in the last 10 years or so. What a fitting conclusion to this epic franchise.
1887,"May 17, 2020",10,What a wonderful movie👌We are just glued to every scene with excitement
1888,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"This movie does not stop delivering. You cannot miss this one. I say every MCU movie is better than the last but trust me when I say that this is the one you've been waiting for. I didn't think they would be able to top Infinity War but it's twice the movie. It's funny, it's sad, it's awesome with scenes that will make you want to throw your fists in the air. The entire cast gives their greatest performance yet. I was very angry when Star-Lord fudged everything in the last movie but if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have this masterpiece.Thank you Marvel."
1889,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"Its a Bit underwhelming for this last thing.But you can watch it without out dying, although ist pretty sad."
1890,"Oct 25, 2021",9,"#MCUrewatch. This is the big one. It all led to this: the big finale of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is epic filmmaking at its best. The original Avengers shine. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye: they all get their great moment. It is a fitting conclusion to the character arcs of especially Iron Man and Captain America. But, in revisiting the previous movies, also a fitting reward for the fan of this franchise. More then 10 years and 20 films. One overarching story. It is a mammoth achievement in film history."
1891,"Apr 26, 2019",7,"A lot of people clearly liked the Avengers: Endgame. I heard Chris Evans cried in some places when he watched the finished movie. I could see what he meant but I didn't cry. In fact there was so much going on that I felt I needed a scorecard. Who was on screen, what was their motivation and what happened 2, 3 or 4 movies ago. I have seen all the movies but clearly not as up on it as some I met, who apparently had seen some of the movies several times.Overall not bad but here are a few moans -The infinity stones always seemed a MacGuffin to me. They appeared from nowhere and had strange powers, often not explained much or used much either.I heard but don't really get Thanos's motivation. He seems to have some hand wavy reason for wanting to reduce the universe's population. Paradoxically, even though, he's the villain it plays into the rather PC idea that there are too many people. People are a blessing, not a curse.Captain Marvel was played up a bit. She's the only one who can save the universe? Apparently she's been busy elsewhere until now.Now in conclusion, not bad but not good. OK movie but could have been shorter for my liking.For comparison, I had a brief look at what I'd watched in a cinema from the last 12 months and the ones that stood out include First Man, Shazam, Glass, Jurassic Wrold: Fallen Kingdom, Deadpool 2, The Happy Prince, Christopher Robin, Green Book, White Crow, Dumbo, Wild Rose. I find most of them better than Endgame."
1892,"May 13, 2019",1,"Terrible movie. I have never been a big fan, of Marvel and even less of MCU, but there were several good movies within that universe.... but this one as the Infinity Gauntlet, destroyed all.... No sense to talk about, the respect of the comic source.... but Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others involved on their comic origin of the characters has to be suffering in hell seeing how their creations were terribly undermined....... but just analizing from a cinematographic point of view, this film has a terrible argument, script, direction and very poor characters.... 2 hours of the film were not needed, and all the structure that were builded for this collapsed with this ending. Plot holes and nonsense everywhere.This film represents what social media can do.... in a bad way. Stay away, if you can."
1893,"May 2, 2019",10,"Great content, well built, and doesn't seemed rushed."
1894,"Sep 22, 2019",8,It's not as good as my expectation but it's still a must watch film for superhero fans
1895,"Apr 30, 2019",10,The best movie marvel ever made Just the right amount of action and drama
1896,"Apr 29, 2019",8,"Once again I debated with myself, whether I should write a review here. I know most of you won't like what I want to say. I also know with over 4500 reviews already here, most of those who may agree with me, won't even get to see it. It will simply get lost in the sea of fake reviews (paid or otherwise) flooding most of internet sites dedicated to such things. But eventually I decided that keeping what I want to say, in my belly will hurt more. So - here goes:It's a great film based on a few false premises, some of which I already discussed here more than once. See on my review page what I've written about Infinity War, or Captain Marvel. In my personal book, every time a comics superhero dies, somebody made a mistake he (or she), didn't know how to fix. The control directors and script writers have over this sort of material is un limited. So if people don't like the character, and I mean real people not review writers that have a personal grudge against superheroines, because the actress is Israeli or because she was made too strong. If real people don't like the character, you wrote it wrong. Let's agree, it didn't happen here. People love the MCU characters, they were all beautifully written, and each actor performing them did wonders. They became as real as fictional characters can. So I knew what happened in this movie had to happen. I even wrote so in my review for infinity war. I must admit, I didn't guess the way they'll go about it, but I knew the many franchises, stemming from the MCU couldn't end. It wasn't a secrete, they kept on working on some sequells while working on this movie. And still, they did surprise me (and everybody else too). But, this sort of a surprise, dosn't cut it for me. Let's carry on with the toy box imagery, that the Russo brothers spoke about in their own IMDb interview. Think about going to play with your friend, he/she shows you a boxful of amazing toys, ""I love them to pieces"" they say, and the very next thing they take out a hummer and break some of them to smithereens. Surprise you? didn't I"" yes, you sure did, but you're an idiot. And the fact, the entire movie prooves you're not, is making it even worse.There's no reason in the world to drive the franchise this way, apart from the ego of the people having all the toys, their stupid wish to surprise us and to proove they really can do whatever they want.I may have high esteem for their abilities. I have to agree, it was a great movie - I really didn't like it. And all the reasons for the ending we got, that I can think of, are making it even worse."
1897,"May 2, 2019",10,"Before Endgame, The Dark Knight Rises was my best superhero of all time. But now without any doubt I can clearly say that this is the best movie ever made. Every single second of my life that I've spent watching this movie worth it. The ending made me a little sad but I think every journey has an end."
1898,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"Just after watching the movie I wanted to write a bad review comparing this with another creatures of cinematography from different genres which I personaly prefer more, but then I thought - why should I be so biased to a certain category of movies, revised everything and understood that this picture is oustandingly well. First, it logically continues where we left in the previous part, from which that movie is significantly different - overall mood seems to shift from seriousness and in some degree of sadness to more bright and hilarious composition. Plot is not completely straightforward and persuades a viewer to continue watching. The really bad thing is that there were some moments which in case of applying a deep inspecting seems to be silly, but, one the other hand, it could be understood as providing a simplificated view on the story, something balancing between nice-captured one without a plot and one having a plot but without any beautiful scenes. Surely, there are lots of computer graphics, but, though, there are too many realistic battle scenes as for me, and even as I can't say that image lacks beautiful scenes, I would increase quantity of colorful episodes. As a result - the movie worth watching definetely, but make sure that you watched at least the previous movie - then you'll get much bigger outcome since these two strongly connected in the logical sense and tell a single story."
1899,"May 3, 2019",1,"The half part is boring, and its not really fun to see so many super hero, not a really good inspiring story or no story at all. Glad it finally ends."
1900,"May 13, 2021",10,I would say the MCU has been perfectly executed and Avengers Endgame provided the prefect closure for the Infinity Saga. Can't wait for what MCU brings to the plate next!
1901,"Jan 24, 2020",10,For people who are saying something is not realistic we are talking about a marvel movie with superheroes who fly have superhuman powers and survive things that are insane. I do not understand why anyone would compare this movie to anything. The CGI is masterpiece. This was meant to be fun and imaginative. Marvel series never tried to be realistic.
1902,"Jul 2, 2023",10,"For a conclusion to the 21 film Infinity Saga, Avengers: Endgame does the impossible and perfectly finishes the saga and wraps up the story in such a perfect way that it's hard to find fault with it. From seeing how all the characters are coping or should I say struggling from the fallout of Thanos's snap, to them all banding together ""One Last Time"" to triumph over evil, it's a film that I can happily say is perfect. Although Marvel movies constantly get criticised for being ""not real cinema"", this is a film all ages can sit back and enjoy with someone for the kids as well as the adults. Knockout performances from all the cast for Robert Downey Jr, to Josh Brolin. In summation, a beautiful Comic Book film that I can sit back and say ""this is why I love superheroes"""
1903,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Thank you MARVEL studios for the 10 years of journey. The movie was brilliant and mind-blowing. 3 Hours felt like nothing. I only watch any movies once in the cinema, but this one, I wouldn't mind to watch it a couple more times. Will watch it again this weekend. The best movie I've ever watch in my whole life. Go and grab your tickets now, you wont regret it."
1904,"Jul 31, 2019",7,"Brie Larson is simply bad, somewhere between terrible and bland. She's the worst thing about this movies and if it weren't for the not only great but incredibly charismatic cast she'd have definitely tainted this movies. That said, watch it."
1905,"Sep 14, 2019",10,Movie was fantastic I love it I am big fan of Tony stark love you Tony
1906,"Apr 24, 2019",6,This is a superhero movie. It doesn't deserve a 9.3 rating. Better than Godfather? Shawshank? Are you kidding me?It belongs at 7-8. Rated 6 to adjust for voter stupidity.
1907,"May 5, 2019",10,Most satisfying ending ever. My childhood is complete.
1908,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"The build up, the Easter eggs, the story line across all 21 previous marvel movies have led to this moment and oh boy do they execute well. If you're a casual watcher you might not get why everyone loves this movie so much, which is unfortunate because you should really watch every movie in order before this to appreciate the entire story.Probably the funniest marvel movie too (sorry guardians/ragnarok) but this movie made me laugh, cry, and had me on the edge of my seat. Thank you Russo brothers, thank you Kevin Feige, thank you to all the cast and crew I LOVE YOU 3000"
1909,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"You can enjoy all things and in order to win you have to lose something, this movie represents very good that philosophy."
1910,"Oct 13, 2019",10,"This is a masterpiece. Don't listen to the bad reviews they have no idea what they are talking about. This is great at showing character development, especially with Tony Stark. Probably the best movie I have ever seen."
1911,"Jul 27, 2021",7,After infinity war I really had very high hopes from this. Bit disappointed-
1912,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Epic conclusion, really enjoy all the mcu movie... Definitely must see Amazing ,emotional movieLove it"
1913,"Apr 25, 2019",6,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a behemoth. A cultural phenomenon that has enveloped the minds of audiences everywhere. Since 2008 when 'Iron Man' graced our screens in a small yet metal-bashing blockbuster, we knew something big was happening. Deep down. And now, eleven years later, this fantastical journey of spectacular conflicts and personable characters has come to an almighty conclusion. Generations have been anticipating, for a whole arduous year, how the remaining Avengers were going to stop Thanos post-snap.The burning question raised from this extravagant superhero soap opera: Does Endgame sufficiently conclude the franchise? It's an inescapable thought. Endgame was no longer just a film in an elongated series of interconnected stories. It was answers. We needed them, and we needed them executed satisfactorily.So, does it? Yes. A resounding yes. My inner fanboy was pleased with the sheer amount of fan service shoved into this epic three hour beast. The third act especially, which we all know is the climactic battle (I believe I'm safe to say that...), is teeming with mesmerising energy as the Russo brothers shove as much glorified content as they possibly can. However, do not mistake my inner child-like demeanour as a critical analysis of the film, for am I not blindsided. It's very easy to succumb to the colossal amount of fan service and forget about the criticisms. I would not do that to you.Treating this film as I would any other, I found myself embroiled with many reservations. This is not a perfect film. It is flawed with contrived plot conveniences and a narrative structure that segregates its tones far too excessively, consequently producing inconsistent pacing. Problem is, I am unable to discuss these issues with you. In fact, it's one of those rare films to which I can't really say anything at all, for it may be deemed a spoiler (and I'm not falling down that Asgardian pitfall again...)! Let's try though.The first act explored the humanistic drama beneath these heroes. Conflicting emotions as they adjust to the immediate vacuous lives after the events of 'Infinity War'. An interesting direction from the Russo brothers took which injected a dark melancholic aura, cementing the finality of this franchise. Then, the second act kicks in once a particular character is re-introduced. Let's just say I wasn't overly enamoured with the film during the second hour. Intrinsically implementing a barrage of references from previous entries, to the point that it becomes overstuffed and a detriment to the overall arc of the plot. The beautiful development of Thanos from its predecessor seemingly shattered in this instalment, resulting in a simplistic antagonist. And the exaggerated comedy came across as desperate, especially from Thor. Whilst appealing to general audiences and acting as a crowd pleaser, it unfortunately didn't gel with me. I blame 'Ragnarok'.Thankfully the third act saves the day, with what I can only describe as a sublime celebration of the cinematic universe. That is what Endgame is all about. Celebration. From the heart wrenching moments (yes, please bring a tissue or twenty) to the chaotic action, the Russo brothers celebrate eleven years of work into three hours. The last hour was entertainment done perfectly, and left me with moist eyes and a smile across my face. Performances were top notch from all cast members, especially Downey Jr., and I had minimal qualms with the visual effects. A few action scenes were edited haphazardly, but just a small nitpick in the technical department.So, let me change the initial question. Is Endgame the perfect superhero blockbuster? No. I would go as far as saying I believe 'Infinity War' was better executed and remains the best 'Avengers' film (not to be mistaken with best MCU film). Yet, regardless of my insignificant disappointment for the film itself, Endgame had enormous pressure. It could've simply buckled under the weight. But it didn't. For that, I applaud Marvel Studios and everyone involved. You don't need me to tell you to go and see it, just do it."
1914,"May 5, 2019",3,"I am sort of sorry that the rares time I write a review, it is not a kind one. But I am sorrier still that the rares times I watch theater movies, it is because of high ratings of previous reviewers.Yep, that is how i chose this one.""Astonishing"", ""perfect"", ""masterpiece"", ""9 out of 10"" were some of the comments and ratings around, so I thought, this must be it, if I have to see one movie this year, it's this one.But honestly :Special effects, are good.Plot is so plain you understand what is going to happen and how it is going to end in the first ten minutes. And there are no twists whatsoever. Everything is pretty much recycled from other movies - not talking about ""avengers"" or marvel series; rather, just any SF movies out there were used as ideas sources to fill this one. Nothing new, nothing different.Yeah, there are a few nice jokes, and some fat, both so badly plugged you can see the stitching (you'll understand when you see it). In the past, when heroes were making jokes during a battle, it was to show they mastered the situation, and it was fitting the atmosphere and pace; in this one, you can see at some point the director absolutely wanted to put a joke in the middle of the main battle - broke the rythm and half spoiled the mood just because of that.Movie is three hours long.I just watched two episodes of an old anime series from the 80's, and in those 46 minutes, there was pretty much as much action and stuff going on than in these almost-three-hours of medium paced show. So although people say it was needed to fit all the references to previous marvel movies, i'd rather have less references and more things happening in this one.As it often happens in these follow-ups, previous movies created such an intricate situation that this one solved in such a straight-forward way, it felt as if somebody wanted it rushed to the finish.And in order to do that, it took the party of a lousy quantum physics theory (which is actually wrong, btw), and left some important side question unansweredAnd not to talk about the mania from the producers to destroy stuff that went on for décades, or millennia, all in the timespan of a few years! We had ragnarok, the death of Odin.. And now.. this? Well without spoiling the movie for those that want to see it, I'd say it looked like they wanted to make sure that this put an end to the story. Even if that meant to break the logic of these movies : ""Thus far and no further we shall make avengers movies"" God complex, perhaps?All in all, it wasn't any better than an old Flash Gordon movie, except for the SFX that are of course more modern. I'm giving it a 3 out of 10, as 1 and 2 are reserved for movies that don't deserve watching till the end. But I believe that once the paid comments and the avengers mania will be past, many other will downrate this, that definitely did not deserve all that advertising and praise it received so far.Definitely a cash movie, nothing more."
1915,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"I'll start by saying that the last battle is the best battle in the whole Marvel universe. It starts like an hour before the movie ends. The first two hours has some boring parts, but they are relevant. It is a great movie, top 2-3"
1916,"Sep 23, 2019",10,It is the best movie ever . Nothing can beat it . Those who are giving negative review just GO. TO. HELLLL. #avengersassemble
1917,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Epic... simply EPIC! Hard to find a better word. Just... Epic! Bravo!
1918,"May 13, 2019",10,"This was the first time that I watched the film of this series and I was feeling bad about what I have missed by not watching any of the movie of this series. The VFX, CGI work is amazing because of which it looks amazing on screen especially in 3D"
1919,"May 3, 2019",10,"Perfect conclusion to the 22 film saga satisfyingly wraps up several characters' multi-film arcs, while opening up possibilities for several others; that said, it's not without its faults, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly.#nitrosMovieChallenge."
1920,"Apr 28, 2019",7,"I have more questions then answers. The ending felt rushed and the middle really added no value. But overall, it was a fun film with plenty of humor and some good action, although the action seemed too busy at times."
1921,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"The best superheroe movie ever, every single moment is unexpected with an epic end"
1922,"Apr 26, 2019",7,So let me start of by saying that the movie was good. But it was not as good as Infinity war. The movie starts off very instant and with no real lead to the previous one. It also has a very slow build up i mean literally nothing happens for 75% of the movie. I wish they would have made more happen during that 3/4 were as in infinity war they had stuff happen all the time from start to finnish.I can also add that cm was absolutely not needed for this movie.Pretty bad review i know but that's my honest opinion and a rightful one. People praising this movie to the stars are blinded for sure.It's a good movie in the sense that it's watchable and has some fun and good times mostly with Thor and then a goodbye that leaves you with tears.But nothing compared to Infinity war.7/10 stars while i would have given infinity war 9/10.
1923,"May 5, 2019",10,"It's been a week since Avengers : EndGame hit movie theatres. Since then, I've been trying to wrap my mind around the idea that it is really over.. This week saw EndGame breaking long-held records and creating new ones. It has made 1 billion and over $900 million worldwide! Almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been already said. Like so many others; nevertheless, I was and am profoundly emotional. I've always studied catharsis yet for the first time, I lived it. EndGame showed me the true meaning of catharsis; it purged me. It was beyond what I expected and I expected phenomenal! It was an experience like no other, a masterpiece. I laughed, cried, cheered and cried some more.. I was a complete emotional wreck towards the end. I was a ten-year old boy again. It took me to a journey which I've been part of. I was nostalgic. I saw myself in every piece of it. The movie was a capsule of memories.. This is history, the world came together to witness an end of an Era. All shapes, ages, sizes, colors, religions and genders. It was a national event! Marvel showed us how movies should be made. I've loved Lord of the Rings, I've loved Harry Potter, I've loved Star Wars. But I have LIVED the MCU. We can never be thankful enough for what you've given us. From a small kid who watched Iron-Man in 2008 with zero expectations to the man who watched EndGame three times after a week of its premiere! It was not easy for Marvel to start the MCU. Marvel had to sell some of their rights to other studios in hope to start the MCU. Things didn't go quite as planned. Therefore, Marvel gambled its rights to all of their characters to get a loan of $500 million to start the #MCU. It was a risk worth taking. A well-earned success; not only for Marvel but also for the fans, myself included. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Marvel, thank you StanLee, Russo brothers, Kevin Fiege, writers, producers and actors. Thank you, Robert Downey Jr. the one who started the game and the one who finished it. He created one hell of a legacy. I never want it to end, but ""Part of the journey is the end."" I am really grateful for being part of that journey. I love you 3000"
1924,"May 9, 2019",9,"Of all 21, this one was a tear jerker. I couldn't keep my tears in my eyes. What I call the first part of the movie was a bit slow, but it picked up for sure. I loved the way they brought back familiar characters from previous movies. They did an excellent job bringing back those individuals we thought we'd never see again. The ending fight was just the best, it was awesome, words can't explain. Just see it!!"
1925,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I'm speechless. This masterpiece rewards you for your waiting. Absolute perfection. I have nothing to say yet I want to say everything. I cried like a little girl, i laughed, I screamed. This movie makes everything worth fighting even when there's no hope left. Thank you Marvel, thank you.3000/10"
1926,"Dec 30, 2019",10,"Got to be the best super hero movie ever, ignore all the bulls*it reviews! 1/10 and that ideats, what a movie"
1927,"Apr 26, 2019",10,(Spoiler Free) This movie was absolutely amazing! A great culmination of the last 11 years of the MCU. See it in IMAX if you can.
1928,"Apr 30, 2019",6,"As a Fan I feel Like cheated by Marvel Studios. Avengers: Endgame is a cut paste collage of previous movies & sloppy VFX ( one can watch it under magnifying glass when its Blu Ray is released). Within 3 hours of this movie 1.5 hours was of repetitions. After all the hype, theories & speculations, All that Anthony & Joe Russo cooked was a plot that even a Kindergarten MCU fan could've scripted better and Many succeeded with their far Superior imagination & theories than MCU team. Time Travel is a pathetic excuse to deal with Thanos after all the wonderful Avengers Series MCU has executed on Cinematic world Arena. It felt like they knew Endgame would be the Big Hit so they served the old potpourri with not more than 10 minutes of WOW action moments. Stan Lee's demise affected the outcome of this Movie that could have been the Milestone for Cinema Entertainment for Years to come. Wonder if this is highest Peak of MCU's Success Story. 6 Stars for many disappointments"
1929,"May 12, 2019",10,Marvel just keeps delivering. This a fantastic topper for the 21 previous movies as well as establishing more for the future. And apparent plot hole have been quickly filled by the writers.
1930,"Aug 18, 2019",7,"It's hard to criticize Endgame, given its enormous success. It certainly had its moments, the scene with Hawkeye and Nat was incredible, and the closing scene was really cool, it really made the viewer feel like he was part of the Marvel pantheon. But I wouldn't be in any hurry to see it again, and I watched Endgame 4 or 5 times. I've heard the latest Spider-Man gets the Marvel universe revved up again, so that will be fun."
1931,"May 1, 2019",3,"After all these years THAT is what we get? A movie that makes no sense whatsoever, Because every time i try to figure something out about the movie another plothole appears.. X-Men3 The Last Stand is a masterpiece compared to Endgame and thats saying something! 3 stars only for Tom Holland, love him as Spiderman"
1932,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"Hands down the greatest comic-book movie I've ever watched, and honestly one of my favorite blockbusters of all time. It was b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l."
1933,"May 12, 2019",9,Growing up with the Marvel universe may sway my opinion a bit but this is one of my favorite movies. It balances all of the characters extremely well and never gives too much screen time to one character. The plot is just the right amount of complicated and just the right amount of funny. Avengers Endgame is perfectly balanced.
1934,"May 9, 2021",10,"This film is awesome, simples.The ones saying it's rubbish etc are just trying to be 'Edgy'.Don't read the reviews. If you like comic\super hero films, then this is a must."
1935,"Apr 17, 2021",10,"Even though infinity war was better this movie was still amazing. I like everything about this movie! Even the time travel part which is considered quite lame. And for some reason I can only see 1 star ratings, just WHY!"
1936,"Jan 31, 2023",10,"There are no spoilers in my review. I enjoyed the movie. It did a good job of tying everything together. The fight scenes and special effects were great, it's a fun movie! This movie is definitely filled with a lot of familiar faces. Some folks who aren't with us anymore, so it's bittersweet to see them. I would definitely watch this movie again. Watch closely because it foretells of some things to come. I like when movies drop little nuggets like this. It gives you something to look forward to. I also like that the storyline is continuous, it makes the movies easy to follow and pick up where you left off."
1937,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Honestly i could not be happier with the outcomes of this movie. The way they have assembled all the 21 movies in 1 epic 3 hour screenplay is mindblowing.Unbelievable. This is it. This the #EndGame !Ladies and Gentleman. Be Ready. Enjoy!
1938,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"This movie was a perfect wrap up to the Avengers franchise. This movie will have you laughing, clapping (more than you think), and of course... crying. When Iron man said in the trailer ""part of the journey is the end..."" he is very true. Go see this movie!"
1939,"May 15, 2019",9,"Everything was perfect and amazing apart from like 1 or 2 things. But these things are not major or even minor but things that I wanted to happen that didn't. Would lnt say disappointed at all, but simple things that would ha e made the movie that little bit sweeter.Although this movie was EMENSE!"
1940,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"No words. Absolutely, no words! Just watch this and you will see"
1941,"Feb 18, 2020",10,"Best Marvel Movie. For Marvel Fan, it is a best movie."
1942,"Apr 27, 2019",10,11 years!! 22 Movies!! And Such a beautiful ending This is the finest work from Marvel Cinematic Universe.Every character played their part perfectly! Great Story! Great Direction! MCU LOVE YOU 3000
1943,"Jul 27, 2019",10,It's was one of my best Experiences ever. It's a memory that I will share with my childrens & Grandchildrens
1944,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"Honestly, I think there are too many Heroes for one movie so Thanos definitely helped us out. That said, the writers do exceptionally well to weave all the back stories, relationships, characters and emotional hee-haw together in one crazy 3 hour rollercoaster ride of CG action, emotion and gags.Great fun but I yearn for the simpler single hero movies of yore, even though I still think the first Avengers movie was the Greatest!!!That said, this will break every box office record as it is a MUST SEE!!!"
1945,"Mar 24, 2021",3,This movie has a terrible plot and could be the worst movie I've ever seen
1946,"Oct 6, 2019",10,"I'm eating peanut m$m's while boringly reading crap reviews, I would like to talk to some of these people and ask what they want. Why can't people just enjoy movies, it's a super hero movie, nothing is real. It's for fun"
1947,"Jun 13, 2020",10,Im glad to live in a time where this movies existing.
1948,"Jul 18, 2020",10,"Probably the best 3 hours in movie history. A cinematic experience everybody should experience. Exceeds expectation, 'nuff said."
1949,"May 1, 2019",4,"Avengers Endgame - what a disappointment. Too long, too boring and too sappy. What was I watching - soap opera? Low on action, full on drama, corny dialogues about friendship and family. The hall was supposed to be houseful according to bookmyshow and PVR, bullshit, it had less than 1/4 seats full. Something very fishy is going on. Totally anti climactic after Infinity Wars and Thor Ragnarok. The direction Marvel has chosen after Captain Marvel and Now this. Seems like films are statistically driven now, with an eye on how to make the film click - by hook or crook. Captain Marvel - Woman driven, here too there is one scene clearly pushing that agenda. In the last battle there is a shot where all the woman get together for the final fight - just by chance. The entire focus for this move was, high on emotions, must have done some calculations for that is what the box office collection tell.If I had got an honest review I would have given this movie a skip, you should too."
1950,"Mar 16, 2023",10,"The conculsion of the arc set up in the first three phases of Marvel is, to say the least, without a doubt the best MCU film to date. That is no small feat.Rather than just undoing the brilliant dark ending of its predecessor, it delves into the failures and shortcomings of the outcome in a brilliant and very important way, that is not often seen in these kind of lighthearted adventures.There are lots of brilliant twists and turns that are very much appreciated, and without spoiling anything, this film handles all that is set up in Infinity War gracefully.Overall, it is a beautifully made film, some of the best effects ever seen in film and incredible cinematograpy and cutting. It features some of the best battles ever put together.Truly a grand finale that I am glad to have seen at its premiere. Fantastic finale, and there is more, far more, to come from this wonderful franchise!"
1951,"Apr 28, 2019",10,The most amazing and mind boggling movie that i watched till date
1952,"May 9, 2019",10,"Amazing, poignant, huge and beautiful. Nothing more to say other than this film delivers and is the perfect end to this run of films!"
1953,"Apr 29, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame is probably the most hyped and the most anticipated release of 2019. Marvel's Avengers that has continued to entertain and wow us for so many years has finally come to a conclusion that has all the World held in its thrall.In the previous movie, Avengers: Infinity War, we saw Thanos erasing half the population including many of our favorite Avengers from the planet and in this film, the world is still trying to grapple with the loss. I will not reveal the plot but suffice to say that the story while a bit slow in the first half had me glued to my seat throughout. The twists and turns are so well planned that nowhere did they seem predictable and lest you breathe or break concentration, you will find yourself missing the many memorable moments in Avengers: Endgame.Everyone right from the Avengers to the supporting characters from previous movies of the Avengers franchise make an appearance here and what an appearance it is! You will feel like reuniting with family after many years of separation and left with a heart full of a myriad of emotions- happiness at meeting them again, sadness at knowing that this will be the last time we meet them and satisfaction that many of our beloved characters get their happily-ever-after.Avengers: Endgame is a movie well planned and expertly executed. The joy of having all my beloved heroes and heroines at one place is beyond words and the feeling of loss knowing I will never see them again together is heart-wrenchingly real. Stan Lee's last cameo of his life and the last in an Avenger's movie was so beautiful that it brought a smile to my face as well as sadness to my heart.I stayed off social media lest I accidentally read a spoiler until I watched the movie! A movie that not only wraps up the Avengers chapter beautifully but also justifies each second of the three hour-long story, Njkinny recommends Avengers: Endgame to everyone. Go watch with friends, family or alone. Don't miss out on the unforgettable feeling of seeing an exceptional saga of heroism, friendship, love, and sacrifice come to a memorable conclusion in this film.Super shiny 5 stars to it from me and this is a movie that I can watch again."
1954,"Apr 28, 2019",7,"It is indeed a fan-desired perfect end to a superbely balanced cinematic experience. A well hammer-hit nail to the hall of fame of Marvel movies but as a movie on its own it is indeed a 7 for me. As a wise man once put, ""too many cooks spoil the food"" is the perfect epigram to how I felt (mind you) ""watching the movie in it's own original form."""
1955,"Apr 29, 2019",8,"I watched Endgame in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!It may have taken 11 years, 21 films but Endgame finally has shown redemption Connecting and linking this movie with the past films is not easy and smart direction from Joe Russo and Anthony Russo. It is not only about superpowers but about love commitment, compassion and sacrifice. Tony Stark removes his ego and Steve Rogers finally got what he wanted.The only con of this movie was the running time. The three hours could have been scrapped or at least an interval to go to the loo.!My score= 8.5/10"
1956,"May 3, 2019",7,"Good movie and thats all.. Before I saw the movie, I heard nothing but how great the movie was. all the reviewers were so high that i thought it was the best movie in history. but actually the film was good enough and no more. It was too much hype. It was more of a drama movie than an action movie. All the other MCU movies that have been before this one are better than this one, hands down"
1957,"May 2, 2019",4,I expected an action movie with a real battle. Unfortunately it was just a loong and boring exchange of lines..
1958,"Apr 25, 2019",10,Just amazing. The humour combined with the emotional turmoil makes this one of the greatest films ever. I didn't think there could be a fight scene as intense as infinity war...I was wrong. Just amazing!
1959,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"The perfect conclusion, that pretty much sums it up. Over ten years and more then 20 movies led to this moment. Similarly to Infinity War, End Game had a lot of hype to live up to, and it did so seemingly effortlessly. The story, which on paper sounds quite simple, get the stones back and fix everything, takes some unexpected turns here and there and I have to applaud the filmmakers for making it so damn entertaining. The movie shines in being extremely funny, heartbreakingly sad and also filled to the brim with pulse-pounding action. The cast, which we know so well, all work with each other seamlessly. Special shoutout to Robert Downey Jr for giving by far his most vulnerable and amazing performance as Iron Man thus far. The climax of the film is one for the ages, similar to the final battle in Return of the King. The special effects, the score and the editing were naturally amazing, nothing less than expected from what these filmmakers have given us before. There is also plenty of fan service, sometimes a little too on the nose, but the plot and the characters are treated with the respect the Russo's have earlier shown to have for the franchise. Whatever turn the franchise takes after this, it will probably be exhilarating."
1960,"Aug 28, 2020",9,"I gave infinity war a 4 out of 10 for a variety of reasons. But the main reasons were that the ending wasn't conclusive even for an MCU film, and the villain's goal seemed extremely contrived. His goal even seems ridiculous to me within the realm of typical superhero villain motives.I felt annoyed that no hero character ever tried to intellectual argue with Thanos about his plans. No one ever asked why Thanos he couldn't try to use the infinity stones to make more resources rather than fewer inhabitants. Or why he felt that every planet was identical to his home planet in needing half their inhabitants to die, given the evidence of each planet have distinct differences problems.Nevertheless, I like the story idea of half of the main characters dying and needing to be saved by the other half. I just felt that a more unhinged villain or an accident could have been a better excuse for such a mishap occurring and needing to be resolved in Endgame. I was especially annoyed at the point when they nearly had the glove off Thanos before losing focus.But luckily Endgame is about solving the problems of Infinity War, and that story is a lot more fun and acceptable. Even if it involves time travel, at least none of the characters act buzzards like the physics of this alternate world.Endgame is the longest MCU film at just over 3 hours. But for me it only feels slow in a couple places.The story also provides some great reminiscing by reuniting all of the original Avengers and eliminating quite a bit of the clutter of so many characters within the last film. Only Ant-Man, Rocket, and Nebula really join the original 6 Avengers characters for the bulk of this film. The film's smaller cast allows for some more focus and growth for Tony Stark, Thor, Hulk, Hawk-eye and others as they each deal with their new normal differently.Even though the film turns out to be a time-travel movie, it also doesn't try to be like the typical time travel movie where changing the past impacts the present and future.The writers use time-travel more as an opportunity to scavenge things from the past and bring them to the present. It's sort of like the past is an alterable mirror reality they they discovered how to interact-with. This does lead to one annoyance for. The writers seem to disregard this narrative near the end when they decide that they must return the stones to where they took them. But overall I excuse this inconsistency because the sequence where they go back in time is very fun and provides for an interesting unexpected conclusion in the end.Like other Avengers movies the dialogue is often funny and the cinematography, music and acting are great.Overall I also given the film bonus points for really being a different kind of action movie then I ever thought I'd ever see. And I appreciate them deciding to not feel obliged to keep all of the characters alive forever. I like even good epic stories to eventually have some endings and conclusions. And the writers seemed to understand that in endgame.Overall it's a great ride. And I imagine if it's watched immediately after Infinity War it might make both films collected average about a 7 out of 10. I just with the infinity war would have been as good as Endgame. That would have really been something special."
1961,"May 4, 2019",9,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a satisfying, expertly made sequel in the franchise and combines with ""Infinity War"" to create the MCU's best, most compelling storytelling. I think that this movie raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it as it stands out as one of the most detailed, satisfying conclusions to a chapter in a long-running franchise. All the necessary heroes get the right amount of screen time and there is a great blend of grief and humor. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a beautifully-constructed piece of popcorn cinema and anyone who has given their time to this world will find it to be a rewarding and effective payoff. The word epic is the right one for this movie. The end. nikisreviews.gr"
1962,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"The perfect blend of action, comedy and emotion and it all works really well"
1963,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Walking into endgame I thought I knew what was gonna happen but wow I sure was wrong with all the twists and turns this movie takes. It really did pay off this giant cinematic universe that marvel did
1964,"Mar 5, 2023",7,"I recently bought both this, and part one The Avengers: Infinity War, used on ebay (as I have boycotted Disney). I must say, I was disappointed (in both), although each has made billions. Most of the Avengers were whiny, pathetic renditions of their former selves. Ant Man was the exception. Regarding the Disney inserts of playful Marvel banter? Many felt VERY forced, to the point where it was borderline uncomfortable to watch. I needed to see it to finish out the MCU. I 'might' watch Guardians 3. Might. Used. I'm not interested in further feeding The Rat that IS modern Disney. So sad, as I grew up in the 60s/70s when Disney was great."
1965,"May 8, 2019",4,"I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but from my point of view Infinity War is way better than Endgame. I do feel like Endgame tried to copy some great scenes from Infinity War, yet those ones were miserably executed. The only thing amazing about Endgame is Captain Marvel and her new short haircut, but that's about all that shines on Endgame :(. I am really disappointed, I really hoped for something better and not that predictable. Unfortunately Endgame lies in a category of movies for which even the trailer is better than the movie.."
1966,"Apr 25, 2020",10,"Josh brolin is a remarkable thanos. He captured the character very well . The emotions , expressions and most of all being the villain in the MCU"
1967,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"It ain't perfect, no movie is, but Avengers Endgame is hitting on all cylinders from start to finish. It'll feel like one of those amusement park rides that once you get off you want to get back in line and ride it again and again.I guarantee you reviewers are using thesauruses to try and describe this movie and will fall short nonetheless.It is epic in every sense of the word. Period."
1968,"Apr 25, 2019",10,It was Amazing and everything I wanted it to be if you are a big fan you are going to love this one
1969,"May 8, 2021",10,If you are Marvel fan you can watch this movie for N number of times and you will not get bored. This was perfect end of the hype and craze created by 22 movies. Every superhero had their own space to express themselves and it is beautifully managed by the directors. For Marvel fan like me it's not just a movie it's emotional send-off to some of the superheroes I admired for a decade. And non marvel fan atleast you can watch this movie for once for life time experiance.😉
1970,"Apr 27, 2019",9,You don't need any review to watch this one buddy. 😂😂😂
1971,"May 4, 2019",1,Worst movie i ve seen since a long time. It traumatized me by forcing me to stay so long in the cinema. Basically a movie designed for kids up to 4y old. (Mentally as well)If today i would have the option to get shot in the stomach 99 times or to go to the cinema to watch avengers i would have 99 problems but going to the cinema wouldn t be one.DON T BUY THE HYPE!!!!! OR AT LEAST TORRENT ITThis rating represents the opinion of 2 persons.
1972,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"The rumors are true: you'll laugh, cheer, and will probably cry several times because I did. A middling first 2 hours that's equal parts cool moments and problematic ones that ends with a final hour that's a downright divine geek wet dream. More character-based than action-based (Infinity War). It is a satisfying send-off and a beautiful love letter for the fans. Salute to the founding members- the OG 6. I love you 3000, Avengers. Thank you, Marvel and Russo Brothers!"
1973,"Jan 23, 2020",10,The movie was awesome. The battle and sacrifices with the twists that I definitely didn't expect. By far it was amazing to watch.
1974,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"All that I can say is, that I loved it 3000, and that the movie was extremely good. There was good action, good humor and overall it was a very emotional and well done film."
1975,"Jun 20, 2021",9,"After Avengers Infinity War , I am eagerly waiting for this movie .We have several expectation form this movie , I can gladly say that this movie has worked on every single part of the movie and none a single second seems to be boring. This movie also became the highest grossing movie for a time . All I loved this movie about that , it has covered all people's expectation , that's why I loved this movie."
1976,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"I think they could have made it better. Overall still a good watch. It is fun and a good spectacle, but storyline could have been better."
1977,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Guys what are you doing lets make this movie a legend to our younger generations let them have the feel of our era's best movie! 10 on 10 guys do it for the sake of iron man!
1978,"May 6, 2019",6,"Didn't meet expectations which were pretty high to begin with after infinity war. As others have mentioned, too many plot holes, too many characters, just did not work for me. Captain Marvel was made to look uninspiring, and was grossly under utilized.the Abengers franchise lost it's charm."
1979,"May 14, 2019",3,"Convenient how they had managed to come up with a time portal disregarding the fact that one of the infinity stones had done just that. This movie is overrated, and pretty much not worth the trip to the theatre."
1980,"May 16, 2019",10,I mean i can't even talk about what just i saw there thank you Marvel.
1981,"May 13, 2019",9,More wonderful movie Enjoy every moment my feelings intertwined
1982,"Apr 16, 2020",10,"I'm just a huge fan of MCU and I've watched every marvel movies ever since Ironman till now. About Endgame, I'm so speechless and to be honest no movie can and will not compare Avengers Endgame film. Thank You #stanLee"
1983,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Best movie ever if you haven't seen it you must go see it specially if your a fan i enjoyed every second of it 😊👍
1984,"Apr 24, 2019",7,"For 11 years marvel has been building up for their epic finale and it is almost safe to say they nailed it With an emotional roller-coaster, breathtaking soundtracks and epic scenes and fight sequences that will be the standard against which all the upcoming movies of this genre is held, Marvel delivered the superhero movie of the decade However, the plot felt a little forced as they were constantly trying to provide the perfect finale - which they almost did -, they filled the movie with plot drivers to reach the epic peak of Marvel cinematic universe But all in all I can safely say that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen and it can probably withstand the test of time as people at different times can sit at the edges of their seats as they see the ""AVENGERS ASSEMBLE""."
1985,"Apr 29, 2019",10,The best movie I have ever seen in my whole life Thanks Marvel
1986,"Apr 26, 2019",7,"I had high expectations. Infinity War was great in comparison to this one. Sadly, Endgame feels like less."
1987,"Jan 7, 2021",1,"After the great lead in from ""Avengers - Infinity War"" I expected an equally well written and logical conclusion in this movie. That did not happen. When I saw the ratio of 10's to 1's in the ratings for this movie I had to ask myself ""Did I watch the same movie as the people who gave it a ""10""? Who are these people that think this movie is the best thing they have ever seen? I could spend many paragraphs laying out the problems with this movie, but you should just read about 10 -15 of the other reviewers who have given this movie a ""1"" rating to see what I am talking about. Same level of disappointment as Game of Thrones final episode."
1988,"May 1, 2019",9,"If you're am MCU fan then this movie is pure magic. The characters have never felt more human, the performances particularly Downey, Evans, Scarlett and Renner are terrific and the third act is pure comic book magic. If you're not a fan of mcu movies then this movie will probably confuse the hell out of you, the Russo's made this movie for all the fans and I cannot thank them, the screenwriters and Kevin Feige enough"
1989,"May 2, 2019",10,"I am not going to give any spoilers here, but WOW. This movie is everything a marvel/MCU fan could want, emotional, yet satisfying, and the humour is just so good, sometimes one may even forget the sad parts. $1.2 billion made in the world wide box office in just 3 days of the movie's global release! biggest box office first day collection yet! Avengers: Endgame is truly one big and memorable ending to the first 11 years of the MCU and the 22 movies before it. It is certainly something that MCU fans have always wanted, but never expected. I laughed, I cheered, but in the end, I couldn't stop crying. People in the cinema were cheering and laughing louder than I have ever heard anyone cheer for any movie yet, although there were moments when the whole audience went silent. Not even 1 week since it's release and Avengers: Endgame has already broken so many world records! From the visuals and CGI/VFX to the way that the story is handled and shown, A TRULY PERFECT MOVIE IN EVERY WAY."
1990,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"***There will be NO SPOILERS in this review***AVENGERS: ENDGAME is an emotionally and artistically satisfying conclusion to 11 years and 22 films of the MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE.Closing out ""Phase III"" in the MCU, the concluding chapter for most of the ""original"" MCU characters/actors, ENDGAME picks up the Avengers story right after the conclusion of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR - a film which saw our heroes lose the battle to Thanos, who snapped his fingers and half the living beings in the Universe vanished.Instead of downplaying the grief that a survivor would feel, Directors Joe and Anthony Russo (veterans of many MCU films) wisely decide to ""lean into"" this grief which gives this film something that is surprising for a SuperHero film - emotional resonance. You grieve with these characters that you have come to know - and love - and share their pain and sorrow.It's a wise choice for it adds a layer to this film that many Superhero films fail to achieve. Along with action, fun characters that you want to root for, interesting visuals and (are you listening DC?) - HUMOR, this film has ""all the feels"" (to steal a phrase) and will leave the MCU fan (both hardcore and casual) satisfied with the experience.Also...interestingly enough...this film stands on it's own quite well. The guy next to me in the theater was a ""newbie"" to the MCU, dragged to the theater with his friends to be ""part of the crowd"" in this experience. Over the first 5 minutes he was asking his buddy a million questions about who is who and what is what...but after that he just settled into his chair and enjoyed the ride for what it is - even jumping up and cheering at a spot late in the film where EVERYONE in the sold out IMAX showing I was in was tempted to jump out of their chair and cheer (yes - there is THAT kind of moment in this film).There is also sorrow...loss...joy...relief...tension...excitement...as I said...""all the feels"". I don't usually tear up at movies, but I felt some glistening in the corners of my eyes and a lump in my throat on more than 1 occasion - sometimes with sadness, but, sometimes, with joy and exuberance. Yes! I had tears of JOY jumping out of my eyes at a few moments in this film.But, if it is Special Effects spectacle you are looking for - no worries. There are PLENTY including a finale that is worthy of being the Final Battle in the Final Film for this Phase of the series.And...the humor...this film has a surprisingly large amount of light, happy moments as well. I give the Russo Brothers - and the MCU - credit for realizing that humor is a good counterbalance to sorrow, action and suspense. I also give them credit for what character they decided to use as the ""comic relief"" in this film. It's a good choice - and the performer tapped to play the humor is equal to the task.But, of course, none of this matters if the characters aren't interesting enough to root for - and this film has it in spades. We've watched these characters grow, develop, bond and tear apart over the course of these past 11 years, so there is quite a bit of emotional investment in the characters - and this investment pays of handsomely (again...if you are a ""casual"" fan or a ""newbie"", you'll be fine). But...if you are like me and are ""into"" the MCU then there is payoff after payoff in this film that is extremely satisfying.The actors in ENDGAME are, of course, at the top of their game. They know they are capping a special moment in their careers and they ""bring it"". Starting, of course, with Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His character goes through a wide variety of emotions through the course of this film and - if this is his last MCU film - he's going out in style. As is Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America. These two are at the heart of this film - and at the heart of the MCU - and they take center stage with aplomb, tweaking their characters while respecting all that came before. To be honest, I never really bought into the Iron Man vs. Captain America ""Civil War"" storyline, but they tie that up nicely.Of course the other 4 ""Original 6 Avengers"" - Chris Hemsworth's THOR, Scarlett Johansson's BLACK WIDOW, Mark Ruffalo's BRUCE BANNER and Jeremy Renner's CLINT/HAWKEYE/RONIN - are on hand and they all have their moments and take their bows as appropriate throughout. I also have to give some ""props"" to Don Cheadle's James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes/WAR MACHINE - kind of an unsung performer in these films and is a welcome sight who would have been missed had he not been there.The other ""survivors of the snap"" - Bradley Cooper's ROCKET RACOON, Karen Gillan's NEBULA and Paul Rudd's SCOTT LANG/ANT MAN - fit in with the ""original"" Avengers quite well. This group of 10 is fun to watch. Add to them Brie Larson's CAPTAIN MARVEL to mix the drink and the concoction was intoxicating to me. A small ""quibble"" and I do mean a ""quibble"" - Danai Gurira and her character OKOYE is underutlized/underused for my tastes, but...that is just a ""quibble"".Oh...and James Brolin is back as ""big bad"" Thanos - a worthy adversary, both emotionally, intellectually and physically for this group of SuperHero's to outwit/outlast/outplay.Finally...without giving away any plot points...this story figured out a way to reflect on/pay homage to previous films in this Universe. It was a clever way to bring back stories/characters/moments from the past and to give some of these performers and moments a nice ""cameo"" curtain call.I better stop now before I give away plot points - needless to say I LOVED THIS FILM - it was a very satisfying way to say ""thank you and goodbye"" to 11 years (and 22 films) of marvelous film making.I'm looking forward to what the next 11 years in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has to offer - the bar has been set at the highest level.Letter Grade: A+10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
1991,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Too be honest I didn't think marvel could top what they did in infinity war but they have just exceeded expectations and brought out the biggest and greatest movie I have ever watched
1992,"Apr 30, 2019",9,"After all this time, after all the movies, after all the laughs and battles we finally get to witness the end to the biggest movie saga of our lifetime. Never before has an endeavor so grand been accomplished and achieved. Avengers Endgame lived up to the expectations and all hype. Per usual Marvel form Wndgame provided a wonderful story filled with action, plenty of laughs and more stars than we could keep track of. This movie gave me chills and had me wondering what would happen next. I know phase four of the MCU is in our future but this culmination of over 10 years of movies was the pinnacle for me. I doubt Marvel will be able to top this story. I won't be spoiling anything here but just know there will be plenty of laughs, tears and tense moments. It's a fantastic ending to the Avengers story. Or is it?? Can't wait to see what comes next."
1993,"Apr 27, 2019",7,Move was good but not great. Lots of plot holes and movie felt way too dragged out. No real surprises since you saw everything coming. My son and I would rate this as the 3rd best Avengers movie. Infinity war being better and the original.
1994,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Absolutely incredible and creative movie. It takes risks beyond our minds and gives the fans a movie to enjoy.
1995,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Such an amazing movie that brought everything to a close but prepared us for the future. Definitely gonna watch it again in the theaters.
1996,"May 5, 2020",10,"Marvel movie series has been everyone's favorite since the very beginning, Avengers Endgame, is such a movie which is filled with immense emotions and above all it is a visual treat, Top class VFX is used in this movie, Viewers will Enjoy the movie till the end, However for a true marvel fan this movie will end up bringing tears in eyes, Because Avengers Endgame Is the End of the Marvel Era for now, in short This movie is an Emotional and Action Blockbuster."
1997,"Jun 27, 2019",10,Perfection That is all i can say I love u 3000 Avengers
1998,"Aug 8, 2022",10,"There is truly no experience or film like Avengers Endgame. It was 10+ years in the making with payoffs that finally came to fruition. Never have I sat in a movie theater so electrifying.I cried, I cheered, I laughed and I gasped in awe moment after moment. Endgame will forever be the height of any theatrical release. The plot keeps you engaged from the second it starts to the bittersweet ending. I've seen it about 12 times now and it'll never get old. Marvel is at the top of the game and is not slowing down."
1999,"Apr 28, 2019",7,"I really want to try a make a decent review about this movie but I can't seem to come to a conclusion whether or not I can definitively like it overall. As far as the plot goes it seemed like a real cop out way to solve all the problems while also leaving as many doors open as possible for future ideas. The story does a terrible job at being able to stand by itself in the cinematic universe as there are so many call backs to past films. Fans who have seen all the movies will have a blast but those who are not familiar with the 21 movie lineup will be left out of the loop. I have to recommend refreshing yourself with some of the significant entries in the universe to fully appreciate the spectacle you are about to see.Like I said in the title this movie has so much fan service that you can't help but leap and yell they actually did that! Of course I will not mention any of it but it had to be said that they get a freaking A+ for adding as much as they did in one jam packed movie. I am honestly trying to express my feelings about the beautiful ending but no matter what I type, it feels as though I am going to give something away. I will keep it short and say they made it so sweet, sincere, and heartbreaking that this may be where some fans will stop watching and say ""this is the conclusion I wanted""... well of course in actuality they won't cause the MCU is awesome but the thought will cross their mind. :)Overall I have decided that I enjoyed watching this entry but still prefer part 1. Mainly because it is concise and straight forward; you really have to be open minded and go with the flow in part 2 which I didn't enjoy."
2000,"May 2, 2019",3,"I am usually a really big fan of anything marvel but seriously what a crappy way to end this saga... Why did the writers need to add in all of the SJW rubbish in the movie? And what's the go with captain marvel? Terrible casting, made me dislike the movie even more... And ruining Thor? He's usually one of the most enjoyable characters to watch. And they turned him into a useless drunk. I really don't understand the high ratings.. Please don't believe the hype."
2001,"Sep 30, 2019",8,"The best superhero movie of all time. Excellent film, the best movie of 2019, in my opinion."
2002,"May 21, 2020",10,"The end is beautiful, is excellent movie marvel. The movie avengers end game is hype 💯"
2003,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"When Infinity War ended last year I said to myself that there was no way the next Avengers film could ever surpass its greatness. Well, simply put I was wrong. Endgame brought the goosebumps caused by the rollercoaster of overwhelming emotions that enveloped the entire audience. Or maybe just me for I was clapping and cheering while the whole cinema remained reserved in its reactions. But anyways the film through its 3 hour runtime brought anticipation, excitement, and a rush of adrenaline through my veins. Every scene has this certain feel that makes you think that you're in the same mess as the main characters are. That aspect gave each scene a certain tension, that of which other films lack. A constant feel of danger so to speak but that also gives you the opportunity to laugh and... well like I said its a plethora of emotions really. I don't want to get in detail about everything in the film but wow, this is history and we get to tell our grandkids how it was to see it firsthand. Simply astonishing 10/10 I am at lost for words really."
2004,"Apr 24, 2019",10,I'm just speechless.....................................
2005,"May 7, 2019",10,"If your a Marvel fan, then you've already seen this film, but that doesn't change the fact that it will go down as the greatest conclusion to the biggest build up of movies ever created. It movies gives you exactly what you want as a fan of the franchise and more. I do believe the movie would be difficult to follow if you aren't an avid watcher of the franchise, however it is abundantly clear that those are the kind of people this movie was made for. It gives you some great character moments (the best of the entire MCU), amazing action sequences, some fan service moments, and even the feels. This is one of those films that I feel everyone should go and see for sure. Watch a few of the previous Marvel films to get an understanding of the franchise and then go see Avengers: Endgame and be apart of history."
2006,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"Other than time traveling, everything else was reasonably good. Time traveling can never give clear answers, but only make more questions."
2007,"Jul 12, 2019",7,"For some reasons I didnt find it as good as its predecessor. Story was average ,at some point it felt it is not moving at all. Linking movie with the pre sequels is very bad specially for those who are watching Marvel movie for the first time. Acting is by far the best from all the characters and bringing back all the characters together in one movie was a great task by Marvel Universe. All in all this movie is not for non-marvel fan. If you have been an ardent fan of Marvel Universe ,this sure will be a joy ride."
2008,"Aug 4, 2019",4,"Sry, but this isn't a 8,7 rating movie. I get that it's all doom and gloom with what happened in the last movie, but u don't drag that out for 2 hours. Main acts becomes sideshows, story is a mess. Put in a bit of woke and u release it. I will not rewatch this."
2009,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"Avengers Endgame truly created a new milestone. Including fun, tears, legends and anything out of your mind, Endgame is the best Marvel Studios Movies."
2010,"Apr 29, 2019",9,"But I don't want to nitpick around here so it's the best ending possible. The 1 in 14 million versions.But I'll start with what didn't work. Firstly, captain Marvel. Why is she even in this movie? She's totally unnecessary and she really felt like a hero from the next generation where the villains are way worse than Thanos (hopefully).Second, Hulk transformation is delivered in dialogue only. The complete reverse of show, don't tell.Second, quantum realm. Everything make sense, there's no obvious plot holes if you believe the character's explanation on how things work but it's a little bit disappointing and it's not as straightforward as in the previous Avengers. Personally, I liked the focus on Thanos in Infinity War, he didn't come as shallow as other villains but in this one the focus is on the Avengers and Thanos is reduced to the villain that conveniently overthrows the heros' plans.It's the classic superhero movie, only bigger, better, more awesome than ever. I was glued to the screen the whole 3 hours but still, I will remember Infinity War forever. And this would have been amazing (and completely different) movie if they just show how superheroes continued their lives after the decimation of the Universe without being able to do anything about it. Instead we get a fitting closure for the heroes that started the Avengers and we are ready to move into a new Era.*spoiler* I cried."
2011,"Sep 15, 2019",10,"This movie was amazing. I couldn't imagine a more perfect follow-up to Infinity War or a more perfect ending to this 11 year, 22 film story arc. This movie is dramatic, it's emotional, it's hilarious, it's fun, it has great action, it's pretty much everything that you'd want out of one of these movies. I think I like Infinity War a little more, but this movie is a close second! That's pretty much all I can say without spoiling anything. This movie has many surprises and I don't want to give any of them away, so just go see it if you are even a little bit of a Marvel fan. As I've stated before, I'm not a big Marvel fan but I really connected with this movie in a pretty meaningful way. This is the film event of this generation. Don't miss it!"
2012,"Apr 25, 2019",10,One of the best movie ever !!!!! The entry the emotion the sacrifices all are just perfectly portrayed... i think watching it for less than twice is a sin !
2013,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"Hmmmm I tried to go into the movie without high expectations, well as much as I could so I wouldn't say I was disappointed but it just wasn't was good as it could have been.Don't want to give anything away so this will be brief but the pluses are great action pieces, plenty of time with our favourite avengers and it ties up all the loose ends perfectly!The issues: Its about an hour too long, takes way to long to get the motive and planning out the way before our hero's actually get about fixing the problem.Similar to Return of the King after the climax of the movie we spend far to long summing everything up and being all reflective.There are some odd character developments which feel a bit like Last Jedi type changes - hmm is it a Disney thing.It does struggle a bit to involve everyone at times - lacking the concise sharpness of many of the stand alone character movies. Overall it is a good movie for sure it's just not as awesome as the likes of Black Panther, Ragnorok or Captain Marvel."
2014,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"This movie is everything we needed, comedy, emotional, u name it. A great ending to a series. (there were some parts which are questionable)"
2015,"Oct 24, 2021",10,"One of the "" MASTER PIECE "" from the team Avengers. This is combination of all movies released from the "" MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE"". This movie is a different type of story because the Avangers try to get back all the "" INFINITY STONES"" before "" THANOS "" Get all the stone to destroy the world and half the population of Earth.EXCELLENT STORY,E GREAT WORK , ."" A MUST WATCH MOVIE "".NB: "" TRY TO WATCH FROM THE BEGINNING OF ALL MOVIE'S FROM MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE"" I LOVE THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH...."
2016,"Apr 28, 2019",10,A great ending to a saga that gave me happiness in many different ways. thank you for all these years of work to reach this perfect end
2017,"Apr 29, 2019",10,I've never seen a movie like that in my life it was perfect in every way and when we talk about Oscar winning movies this better be on the ballot next year as well as the Russo brothers and Robert Downey jr. Heck the whole cast absolutely classic forget Gone With the Wind this is the greatest movie ever made.
2018,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Great to see heroes together fighting. Thanos tge mighty villain had his times but how the cinematography was absolutely brilliant
2019,"May 7, 2019",10,"I mean this movie was just amazing.... from the deaths the characters endured, and how they persevered to come together and defeat Thanos. 10/10"
2020,"Jan 7, 2020",7,"Without a doubt, that's a movie which visuals are stunning as always. That does not disappoint. My main concerns are with the story, some unbelievable situations and battles. The results are not always what you expect, which IMO lowers the rating.It would be a better movie, if the seriousness of situations was increased throughout and the whole current of the movie was based on more active, wild and shocking battles."
2021,"Aug 2, 2019",6,"Well must say,i didnt watch the movie when it hit the theaters and althought i am a big fan of the franchise. I didnt expect a lot, thought i must be a slower pace to tell the story of the world that was created, yet.... it was damn to slow and borin. Without the death of Nat and Iron Man it would be like a Hallmark production. And even the final battle scene was like a copy paste from the last Averngers. Than Captain Marvel was like 5 sec to see, the funny part was only Thor and Hulk?! What the hell was that? I never liked Mark Ruffalo as Hulk but i let it pass, but here in the last Avengers... am actually glad i didnt get to see it in the cinema, would habe been waste of my money"
2022,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"I know this is different from marvel END GAME, LORD OF THE RINGS FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. You only see maybe like 30-40 seconds of a large scale battle with this large scale of a train rolling battle in the end game is way better then fellowship of the ring."
2023,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Overall average movie still infinity war is the best..they ruined some of the mcu characters such as Thor and Hulk. In the last 21 films we knows that how strong is thor bt in the endgame thor was a in a comic role only they ruined the character.emotional weight of the story is rly praise worthy cinematography and visuals are marvelous.like the matter of thor plenty of mistakes is there in the film. Overall average film
2024,"May 11, 2019",10,"The movie was awesome and its really an experience you wouldn't forget with all laughs ,crys & action all you need will be in this movie."
2025,"Apr 30, 2019",10,No words to describe this masterpiece. Not to many movies can give you all those different emotions....from beginning to end. I will go again.
2026,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Just AMAZING AMAZING AMAZINGLY TALENTED GUYS WHO ARE THE ONLY REASON FOR THIS ONE I THINK I WILL BE GOING BACK
2027,"May 6, 2019",10,"Oh my, these guys have done beautifully. I've never been so happy after a superhero movie, like ever. If you thought Infinitty War was awesome, wait until Endgame takes you to infinitty and beyond. Direction is flalwless, there is no part where you feel like ""waiting"". The screenplay has done a very nice job solving many question, although is not perfect. In any way you want to see it, The Avengers Endgame does not dissapoint, and it will be recalled as the best finale ever made for a saga, for many years to come"
2028,"May 9, 2019",7,"Endgame fell short of being the fantastic end that everyone wanted it to be. It had a really slow first third and just when it got going the writers cram some sour brie cheese down the audience's throat, jarring the audience off the edge of their seats. In a repetitive pattern the main characters are constantly thrust situations of peril to be ""saved"" by the timely annoyed arrival of brie cheese. As for the rest of the cast this movie was great well preformed and exactly what you want in a marvel movie up until the next serving of brie cheese."
2029,"May 4, 2019",6,"Watched this movie last week .I have to say that i did'nt like this one as much as i liked Infinity wars.I found it to be predictable in parts plus it was way too mushy for me in certain bits.There was way too much hype for this ,i came out of the theatre pretty disappointed ."
2030,"May 24, 2020",8,"The movie was amazing for me and all other fans of Marvel for sure. If you ain't a fan it doesn't mean that you won't like it. You'll enjoy it due to comedy, action and something more. You might like something else from the movie. It depends on you. I think it would be worth spending your time on watching it. Thank you, Nitin H."
2031,"May 4, 2019",9,"Avengers: Endgame is the epicenter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie encapsulates everything that we have been waiting for since Iron Man. Because it is in fact a Marvel movie, the base level of quality is of course high. This includes acting, score, visual effects, cinematography, etc. Endgame is comparable to Infinity War except it does more. This movie shows our favorite Avengers at not only their lowest, but also at their highest both emotionally and physically. Hawkeye grows as a character, Rocket grows, Banner grows, Thor GROWS. Captain America gets an incredible amount of growth as a character as well but nowhere near as much as Tony Stark. The movie takes the characters we love so much and gives us a glimpse into what it feels to lose like they did. The plot is witty and engaging all the way through and the shifts in tone make sense and transition smoothly. My two gripes with this film which is very close to a 5/5 are the main antagonist that is fought at the very end of the film and the inclusion of Captain Marvel. In my opinion she is the only piece of this movie that seems out of place. If I were to describe this movie in only one word, that word would be epic."
2032,"Aug 29, 2020",10,This is the best movie. wathced it so many times and still watching.
2033,"May 21, 2020",8,"Going through the past scenes is a great review of Marvel's 11 years of film history. Both feelings and laughter can fully enjoy every detail or forgotten. When the lost comrades gathered up the All-Star team again, all the foreshadowing broke out with emotion at this moment. In those days, the six member team now has thousands of troops, and it is a miracle to go to this stage. Two pillars and two curtain calls mark the end of an era"
2034,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Movie throughout was a bunch of thrill... Every 10 min from starting have something new.... Though I won't spoil anything.. Thus didn't like Thor's condition... And yes movie has a quite emotional ending... Have been watching all movie. Since 2008.. it was heartaching.. that my childhood favorite characters... Will not be there on screen... No Thor, no cap, no iron man, no black widow, no Hulk ..... Very emotional moment for me.. But hats off to everyone..."
2035,"May 3, 2019",6,"This is a very weak film that has both good sides and bad sides, a good side is only in the picture and in the humor, everything else is bad, the plot is weak and we repeat ourselves, there are many plot holes, the laws of the universe are violated, sometimes the graphics look very cheap, if the war of infinity is a masterpiece then the endgame is a fan service !!! So bad final((("
2036,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Wow. What a film. What can I say? And epic conclusion to the Infinity storyline.The story was epic, the acting epic and the fight scenes....epic. If you're like me you've grown loving these characters and the storylines they take and after Infinity War you want justice.This film delivers and more. Thanos, best villain to date and the trio of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor are insane."
2037,"Jul 22, 2019",3,"But sheep are watching this in droves....Avengers END-YAWN....... WTF?!?!?!Boring as crap.If they made 2 x 3 hour movies, it would still be boring as crap.But, at least they humanised Thors depression....... although F-wit audiences think it's a joke.morons watching moron movies. Thank Christ to no more Robert Downey Trumpstick."
2038,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Avengers Endgame, as insanely hyped as it was, had 3 hours to show an incredible wrap to 10 years of the MCU. It was unique and all the people saying many aspects of the movie were ""predictable"" are not necessarily correct. Endgame brought surprises other Marvel movies couldn't have done at it's supreme extent. Personally, I caught myself finding the movie less predictable than predictable towards its core plot. This movie is a must see, and you will find yourself captivated all the way through.😇 Thank you for this masterpiece, Marvel 😇"
2039,"May 9, 2021",10,Masterpiece. The avengers endgame marvel is super hit.
2040,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"Well, i believe that this movie was the perfect conclusion to the MCU, the intensity of the movie was outstanding and the amount of action scenes was spetacular. Loved what the movie brought to us, the perfect end to a great sequence of movies that made us grow. THANK YOU MARVEL"
2041,"Feb 25, 2020",10,This is the movie of my life and the best eger.nothing can come to this level of emotions.Seeing cap tony and all the avengers face to face.Its the best.In fact i dont think there will ever be a movie like this again.This is not just a movie its something you live with.This is the best movie of all time
2042,"Jun 29, 2024",6,"After what feels like all the hype in the world and five whole years of time, Endgame couldn't possibly hope to match it, but I was hugely into the breathlessly relentless Infinity War so I was cautiously hopefully for this. As a sequel to that film, it's a very poor one, and is crammed full of illogical half-thoughts and foolish asides. The fat Thor stuff is going to age appallingly and the clunky lampshading of time travel tropes doesn't forgive the heavy-handedness of it all. However as a relatively functional conclusion to over a decade of cinematic storytelling it's pretty impressive. A mixed bag, but things this enormous are rarely satisfying in of themselves, and it's less of an enjoyable film and more of ... well ... a marvel."
2043,"May 20, 2019",1,Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's no way an all-time top ten film
2044,"Apr 29, 2019",10,There is no word to describe this film. Just watch and enjoy it.
2045,"Aug 1, 2019",10,This movie was the best avengers movie and I think it wrapped up the Captain America and iron man storyline very well. This movie was very emotional. The movie did not feel like 3 hours long it felt like a one hour movie . Overall great movie and great Characters really enjoyed it.
2046,"Sep 13, 2021",10,Prefection x 100.I mean we have reached the ending of phase4 perfectly so intruged to see what else is in holds.
2047,"Aug 8, 2019",10,I don't know what should I say.. Time travel in this movie has problem. But this is the best quality of this film
2048,"May 21, 2019",10,"The movie kept me excited and entertained for the whole 3 hours. There was not a moment of me taking my focus of the movie, and that's what good movies do."
2049,"Jun 14, 2019",1,"Worst movie i saw this year boring mess,plot holes,too cheesy,bad writing"
2050,"Jul 29, 2019",10,"An amazing movie, emotional, funny and with so much action! One of my favourite movies! It is worth watching! You will see the best actors of Marvel and the best of the best is Robert Downey Jr. in all the parts of avengers series . It's priceless !!!"
2051,"Apr 26, 2019",8,"If you are fan, it is 9/10, if you like suc movies 8/10, if you watch it just spend sometime with friends etc. it is 7/10. Relatively not much action comparer to previous one, more story."
2052,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Outstanding movie just mind blowing... captain America Ironman Thor Hulk...Just Amazing experience....
2053,"Apr 26, 2019",10,The movie that you just want to watch again and again and again until eternity
2054,"Apr 30, 2019",10,"This movie was a collection of some past marvel sequels.(Avengers,Captain America,Thor,Guardians of the Galaxy)There are some scenes where you will say OMG,if it wasn't you are not a marvel fan.I am not going to post spoilers but remember doctor strange saw a one in a million posibility before he gave up the time stone to save ""Tony Stark"" in Infinity War.You would understand the reason in Endgame."
2055,"Apr 25, 2019",6,"Slow and ponderous with little or no character development or display of the talents they are supposed to have until the end of the film. The plot or storyline is simple and dull. I fell asleep in the film and my only regret is that I woke up and then had to watch the rest of the film, boring and predictable and will not engage you if you have a mental age of over about 16 or under"
2056,"Apr 29, 2019",1,I slept during movie first time in my entire life.I can bare any kind of movie in my life but this was litery garbage movie. My humble request is to stay at home give time to ur family dont waste money on this movie.
2057,"Nov 27, 2019",10,"Endgame takes advantage of multiple genres and elements into a single movie. Involving comedy, mystery, action, drama, and fantasy. The deep character development to 8 unique individuals, instead of just one, is masterful. The contrast between war and peace, as well as the effects it has on people involved was explored on a scale never before seen. The story takes the namesake of the Avengers to a whole new level. I see this winning many Oscars. Best Picture, above all, included."
2058,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Hard to wtite a good review without spoiling anything!This is by far thr best Marvel movie to have been created in the past 10 years! I laughed, i was amazed, i was confused at times and then I nearly cried! I haven't cried at a film since I was a child, but this was the closest I've come!! I can think of no better way that Marvel could have rounded off the series, this film is nothing short of an emotional masterpiece!Well done to everybody involved in making this film the triumph it is!"
2059,"Apr 26, 2019",8,"The movie is great, but not the best marvel movie to date. If you mix Infinity war + the last 1 hour of this movie, you actually get a masterpiece movie (10/10). In the 2 first hours, the movie was slow, and it felt more like a tribute to the 10 years of the marvel universe. I guess they wanted to connect the fans with the older movies. The last hour was excellent, and the action exceeded expectation. Of course, there are some holes in the plot, but Marvel does not let us down. Once again, another movie that Marvel fans won't forget easily."
2060,"Sep 8, 2019",10,Robert Downey Jr.....Chris Evans...Paul Rudd and the Chris....great writing. Nostalgic and whimsy. Intense and loving....the Wit and banter make it all worthy. Oscars should be given out...and kudos the writers the artists and all the actors. For a 40 something lady....loved it and most importantly watching it with my son. 5 stars!!!
2061,"Apr 29, 2019",6,It's an ok movie but do not go in believing all the hype and expecting a perfect movie... if so you will probably be disappointed...they should have cut it down about an hour and it would have been much better
2062,"May 4, 2019",10,"One critic said this movie was a, ""glorious conclusion"". I say it was one nutpunch after another. So..... a glorious nutpunch? Take a hanky..a ton of napkins,....something ti blot the tears away. Trust me...you're gonna need it."
2063,"Apr 24, 2019",6,"Infinity war had set up huge expectation from the Endgame. I was looking forward to the movie but I was mighty disappointed. The first couple of hours of the movie are really slow and dragging. The fight scenes are OK but seems hurried up. The story line is emotional but that is not the weak point for the movie. Some how it felt disjointed and underwhelming. I wish it was as beautifully crafted as the Infinity War. Not sure if we will get any more of Avengers in future , but hey part of the Journey is the end!. Thanks Marvel for years of entertainment :)."
2064,"May 17, 2019",8,"Marvel have done such a great job at creating a broad storyline, that pieces together like a puzzle. This truly is a Marvel fans fandream movie. It does sag a bit in the middle. Some characters are a little underwhelming, Thors storyline was dull. I did feel like there was more invested interest in Captain America, because the Russo brothers have already built that character up so much.But that last battle was amazing. It reminded me of the feeling I got when I first saw the final act of the Attack of the Clones, truly awesome!"
2065,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"Well, Russo brothers did it again. Those 3 hours felt like half hour or less. After watching this story reached its end, I really must say - there is no movie universe like MCU. I love DC and other superhero movies also, but after seeing Endgame - everyone (and that includes future Marvel) really must try hard to beat this 10 years long story and I hope that it will happen again. A man can hope, right?If you read any comic book that has really good story with real stakes (every hero can die) that spans over years and you reached its final number, climax of it all and you are blown away by it - I'm sure you will recognize that feeling while watching this movie (especially in the final GREAT scene, but I don't want to spoil it to you).When I came home from cinema, I needed another ""shot"" of our heroes so I immidiately watched first Avengers movie and Avengers: Age of Ultron. But that is not enough: today I will watch Infinity war at home and Endgame once more in cinema.Than you all for a great movie(s)!Avengers - Assemble!"
2066,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"It might have just been a year since the mouth-opening climax of Avengers: Infinity War, It might have just been 7 years since the first Avengers film, when all 6 superheroes teamup, But it has been 11 years since the beginning of MCU. 11 years, 22 movies, 1 studio. is no doubt that the directors and the teams of visual effects and writing have put their hearts and souls into this masterpiece. The best thing about this film is that even though this movie is about 181 minutes long, it just doesn't feel like it and I was craving for more. They've given so much pressure and importance to character development this time, which felt highly unlikely in a Marvel film, and have succeeded unequivocally. We get to spend so much of the first half with our original Avengers and get to know their griefs. Avengers: Endgame can be described as the wildest, WILDEST dream of Marvel comics fan come alive. A decade ago, people thought of superheroes as ""people with powers"" and that was about it, but the 11 years of built-up have given each of these characters their own time to fight, to kill, to mourn and to finish, and this has bonded us to them, THIS is why we love Marvel movies, and this is also why we don't love DCEU films. At last, I would like to sign off by saying that ""don't be sad, because this may be the end of most of our beloved heroes, but there are several more to come..."
2067,"May 5, 2019",9,"I liked the movie Overral a great way to end the phase 3 and infinity stone saga But i dislike some things, like the movie is too long with little action going on in the middle. The ending battle was not epic enough. With a lot going on but nothing truly truly epic And i hated what they did to thor. It was a nice laugh but it was enough Overral a great experience"
2068,"May 3, 2019",7,"The first 2 hours weren't great. Overall enjoyed it, the ending was satisfying enough. Saw it by myself, the wife wants to go, but I'm not anxious to see it again in theaters. Infinity war was much better in my opinion."
2069,"Jun 20, 2019",8,We're trying to get enough donations in order to produce the next adventure of the Avengers. You can donate Bitcoin to the following address: 1CgsdbCfsTXTajknPSQaCTFXXecFG1j88X
2070,"May 5, 2019",6,"Being the final chapter of Avenger series expectation was very high. Especially because of the superb success of the earlier chapter, ""The Infinity War"" which was undoubtedly a joy to watch. Since the bar was set so high it was not that easy for the movie makers to surpass the hype. Thus in the final chapter makers lack the finesse . There are flaws as the movie was very slow in some parts and it was very lengthy too. Moreover, though it's all fictitious but still the ""Time Machine"" concept looked pretty ordinary. The Iron-Man tragedy was also pretty dramatic and illogical. Otherwise the movie does well. So overall.......... not upto the mark. Expected a lot!!!"
2071,"Mar 26, 2021",1,Waste of time. I regret of watching this film Apart from conversation ah🤣🤣
2072,"Apr 26, 2022",10,This is the best Marvel movies and the most best movie for me it better than dark knight it should have the most high rating. Everyone Have To Watch It.
2073,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Wow it's so amazing. I didn't expect in the final battle. This movie makes me want to cry. No much word to say or spoiler from me, you must see with your eyes."
2074,"Apr 25, 2019",10,I have never cried watching any kind of movie ever but Avengers Endgame touched me deeply in my heart. This movie is everything you want and more. PS: There are no post credit scenes in this movie but pay respect to everyone who made this movie happen.
2075,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"This is an amazing film, which I did really enjoy, and I don't think that story wise it could have been improved. But have to admit that I did prefer Infinity War. I suspect that it managed to maintain such a high octane pace throughout, this one understandably needed a slower pace for the exposition. Also there was just a bit too much humour - the consequences of the previous film are clearly devistating for those left, so the switch to more light hearted banter did not always sir so well with me. Still a must see film and a remarkable example of the true cinematic talent of Russos."
2076,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"I saw this movie the day it came out in my country (Israel) and I was amazed. I was happy, sad, excited, angry all at the same time in this movie, it has everything in it.All our favorite Avengers are coming back and team up again after being broken down and hurt and it's so amazing to see that.You won't regret seen this and of course in the movie theater!!!"
2077,"Apr 25, 2019",10,I can't believe how many people give this movie a 1/10 without any real explanation. Don't give it a bad rating just because you think the overall rating is too high. Stop it. Make a honest review. It's surely not a 1/10.I loved the movie. I have some things that I don't really like but overall it is the best Marvel movie with the most perfect ending you can imagine. Well-done Russos.
2078,"May 31, 2020",6,"This ""movie"" acted more as an event to be remembered as the one of the most build up films of all times. It's full of fan service and predictable character interactions. I did like that it really got people ready to see the movie and talk about it and create theories, but nothing more.Besides the event part, The actual ""movie is pretty mediocre. The acting and cgi is fine, but the plot and writing are almost as bad as Game of Thrones season 8. As a semi spoiler the movie also relies heavily on time travel, which is a horrible plot device in any movie, (unless that's what your entire premise is about). The rest of the movie: sets, costume design, lighting, and action (real movement/choreography) were all fine.Overall I think the ""movie"" will be remembered as a HUGE and fun event of the 21st century, but looked upon also as a weak sequel to infinity war and a mediocre ""movie""."
2079,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"What an absolute gem of a movie. It's not just a movie but a wonder of our times. You just cannot stop appreciating it. The cast, the director,producers and all the team associated. Bravo. You have produced a gem. Thanks for 10 years of love."
2080,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"When you have an excellent team, from producers, writers, screenwriters and good actors among others, comes the result in which fans come to the heading. I'm not going to talk about the movie or what happens, but one thing I can say is that this movie has to be seen as a whole Infinity War (begin) Endgame (end) two parts of the same story, and all the bows that are closed. Endgame is the end of a chapter and the desire for more, and I have no doubt that the public will complain for more of this Universe (MCU) so well worked, so well imagined, so well achieved.This story is much more than a war of titans, heroes, super villain, is about something much more obvious, tangible. It's a well-planned amalgam of drama, action and maturing of various characters, it's all I ever expected from a good story.I think it's an excellent celebration and conclusion to a phase of the MCU with a huge pile of emotions and a visual of biblical proportions - beautiful artwork this movie deserves an Oscar.ps: I would like to know how Thor does that with a beard (understanders will understand )Excelsior ~ Stan LeeI have some minor questions and ""complaints"" about the absence of some events, when you do that in the characters of the franchising those fans will take it bad. Although I understand why they made it like we saw. This movie has a lot of things happening, tons of emotion and probably might need a re watch for those who don't like to miss the details."
2081,"May 7, 2019",10,"I loved the movie soo much especially in 3D, it was everything that we didn't think we want but we need. The ending was in fact satisfying as Chris Evans said in an interview. This the only movie I rated it 10 because it gave us everything we expected and more."
2082,"Sep 24, 2019",8,The Film is actually very well made. But also very Predictable. And you definetliy have to wach the other avengers movies before because otherwise you would Not Understand Most of the Jokes
2083,"Apr 27, 2019",6,"Obviously anyone who has spend years watching MCU movies would go to watch Endgame with high hopes. I went with a hope to have a logical but entertaining end to the saga. I was disappointed. These are my impressions: Movie is 3 hour long but 50% of time is wasted on whining actors who have all but given up after their losses (during the previous movie!) Guys, we already know what happened there, now move on. Film makes these heroes pitiful, sad and tired looking humans- Thor is epitome of what I mean. Well, we have enough of those in real lives and we don't show up at 11 pm to watch that! Storyline was silly and predictable. I wanted to see the re-match between Avengers and Thanos but that was poorly done and I don't even understand how it abruptly ended!Positives were some funny moments."
2084,"May 22, 2019",4,"Even whilst watching it, I felt disappointed: slow, wordy, sloppy storyline. Even the final battle was excessive to the point of tedious: too much fast cutting and too many unnecessary characters. Despite enjoying and appreciating most of the Marvel films, I felt this was a letdown."
2085,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"Was a great end to the Avengers Series. There was laughter, humour, action, comedy, along with emotions. This had it all. Not sure what the buzz about Captain Marvel was but was quiet irrelevant to this story in my opinion. Hulk, Thor stole the show for me. Iron Man and Cap great as always. The 3 hours flew past. I give it a 9/10 just because of Captain Marvel spoiling it."
2086,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"I'm a huge marvel fan, even to the annoyance of some of my friends, and I think that marvel has produced some of the best to be movies to be released in the past decade. I think films like Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor Ragnarok, and the Captain Americas will age as a definitive part of my generation's history. When the first avengers movie released, I was twelve. It would be no exaggeration to say that the movies that followed were a big part of my teenage years. I'm not even a big action movie guy, but I believe in importance of superheroes.This was also possibly the best theater experience I've ever had. Watching this with a theater full of fellow fans is an enjoyment of it's own. Watch this with friends. There were plenty of times I couldn't even keep my mouth closed shut.Even if you're not a marvel fan though, I'm willing to bet you'll still have a blast. The cinematography and effects are nothing if not masterful. Often, the visuals will be enough to stun you completely. The sci fi elements are creative enough to keep the main plot interesting. The character writing is some of the best I've ever seen. The Russo boys really killed it this time, for one last show.The second act of this movie ends up essentially (but debatable, depending on which movies were your favorites,) a kind of ""Best Hits of Marvel"" mix-tape. Then, in the third act, things get so nutty that you can only see it for yourself. The movie is able to call back to the many movies it is, in a sense both a sequel and tribute to, and yet still hold a new and exciting plot elements to explore. It's this balance that holds the whole thing together.Somehow, this movie is able to wrap up almost everything the MCU has left open in creative and fun ways. It's satisfying, but more than that, it feels deserved. This is clearly, to anyone who sees it, the height and end of the long, brilliant saga which began with Jon Favreau's Iron Man.Infinity War was far from perfect, and honestly didn't blow me away in any significant way. This movie did. A million times over, it felt like. It's not just the climax of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's a beautiful monument to the works of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Jim Starlin, and countless others. Avengers Endgame is best described as the ultimate comic book movie.It's over. And at the same time, it's not.""...I posit we are in a universe which favours stories. A universe in which no story can ever truly end; in which there can only be continuances. If we are in such a universe, as I hope, then we may have a chance"" -- Neil Gaiman, Marvel 1602Just go see it. And then see it again. Maybe i'll see you there."
2087,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Growing up on the MCU films has given me a connection to these characters that makes this movie amazing. My only problem with the movie was the step backwards they took with Thor from Ragnarok and Infinity War. But not A big enough issue to lower this from a 10. Well worth the 3 hours, doesn't feel long at all. In fact the pacing was pretty quick."
2088,"Apr 28, 2019",10,But I hearted much more for my favourite character Tony Stuck...
2089,"May 5, 2019",9,"There is a weird glee in watching a movie alone. You start to appreciate the goods and notice the flaws much more easily in a film. Endgame has its flaws. More so than the Infinity war I think. In the infinity war, Thanos was simply an unstoppable force. The sheer desperation to find some way to beat him somehow and still be outmatched by Thanos, in the end, was palpable. Thanos was unwavering; both physically and in the motif - to bring an end to overpopulation. In Endgame, not so much. Thanos only shows physicality and without spoiling it I would say, his motif somehow becomes typically villainous. Thanos is not so much of a ""well-doer of the universe, whatever it takes"" anymore. Another thing is that the Avengers faced quite a less challenge in Endgame, compared to infinity war. Whether it's in procuring a plan to beat him or to execute it, they weren't that much challenged as they were in the previous film. But these things aside, Endgame is a very well rounded film. And boy was it damn enjoyable. Characters were fleshed out really well. The longer screentime really helped in that aspect. All the characters showed heroism and larger than life charisma we expect to see. And the final third of the film was nothing less than spectacular. Endgame is the culmination of 11 years of story-arch. Endgame is the celebration of the end of the Infinity saga. Endgame has achieved something which is really hard to pull off - giving a coherent and satisfying end to the 20 films that came before it. Marvel has succeeded in that aspect and that's where I think DCEU struggles really hard. But Marvel did it flawlessly. Endgame truly is a marvel of a superhero film; and definitely one of the best of MCU; For me, coming in at second place after Captain America Winter Soldier and Civil War. But judging by the hype and rating, is it better than The Dark Knight? NO!!!! Dark Knight still holds the position for the best superhero movie ever made, not even Dark Knight Rises could beat it and Endgame couldn't do it either. MCU and DCEU have the brawn but they don't have the brains of The Dark Knight. But does that make Endgame any less capable? No. Endgame is what Endgame is supposed to be - a heartwarming & proper way to say goodbye to the original Avengers and start a new phase for MCU. And I love it 3000 times <3 #whatever_it_takes"
2090,"Apr 26, 2019",9,Stop reading the reviews & go watch it in theaters..... Its worth it
2091,"Oct 4, 2021",6,"After Infinity War you expect smth special and brain-blowing to end the story. But this is a typical Marvel ""fight-explode-green background"" film. And this stupid/hilarious explanation for time travelling while hipocritically laughing at other time-travelling films."
2092,"Dec 29, 2021",10,10/10 i loved it. It has fanservice and its a really epic movie. I remember in the crowd screaming when captain lifted thor Hammer. I liked more infinity but this is one is a really awesome movie.
2093,"Apr 25, 2019",6,Marvel Avengers Endgame is a combination of 10 years of Film making. It is viewed by many critics as been a top film of the year. Went to see it for Tom Vaughan Lawler as he is a great Irish actor. We see ups and downs. Like most comic book movies it falls flat in the final third of the film. If you are taking your kids to see it don't three hours is a lot for children and trust me they won't sit still. To conclude Endgame is the Endgame for cinematic crossovers possibly
2094,"May 8, 2019",4,"Two hours of boring talk, 45 minutes of action. Overblown and self indulgent."
2095,"Apr 27, 2019",9,Absolutely loved it overall. The only thing I can say is that the there was so much going on that even in a long movie it felt rushed. Could easily add another hour. Great job overall I would just say that infinity war might be the best in the series but really....it was still awesome. I teared up in many scenes. It wasn't that it was sad...sometimes it was. But sometimes it felt so powerful it made me tear up
2096,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This movie had everyone in the movie theatre cheering, laughing and crying throughout the whole movie. Everything you'd hope Endgame to be, IS just that."
2097,"Mar 18, 2020",10,Great and captivating story. Movie ended on a sad note but nothing short of expectation
2098,"Apr 24, 2019",8,"Just perfect.The storyline is amazing and especially how they connected it with the Infinity War.It creates strong feelings.How the story is evolving with the plot twists and all that makes a perfect development.And of course the effects,the sound e.t.c is awesome too.Definetely a must-watch movie."
2099,"Sep 14, 2020",6,"Although this is the usual Avengers fare it comes nowhere near the quality of the previous MCU outings. There are just too many characters in it. Hardly anybody gets a chance to develop. As much as I enjoyed other MCU movies, this one just felt like a bit of a chore. And the final half hour was just grindingly hard work as the camera worked its way through so many Marvel characters, that I wouldn't have been surprised to see all the X-Men, Daredevil, Jessica Jones and the full cast of the Beano thrown in for good measure. But it's still watchable - just."
2100,"May 6, 2019",4,"I felt it the same theme as old movies, May be it is because I am not a hardcore fan of Avengers. Just can watch for time pass."
2101,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Ten years of my life. The core of a five-year friendship. The writers that made me fall in love with the world, the characters that inspired me to be better, the stories that have sewn themselves into my life and given me so much to laugh, cry, and talk about. This was the perfect end to the most important franchise in my life. It was absolutely wonderful in every way, beautifully written and paced, and I can't imagine that there was any possible way, of 14 million, to end this better than it did.I got home and just had no idea what to do. So I thought about how much these stories mean to me, and how much the people in my life mean to me with them.Thank you, avengers."
2102,"May 7, 2019",10,"You may have seen many supehero movies in your lifetime. But i can guarentee you that this is the best one you can see upto now. Its not only action, But also emotions. This is the kind of movie that gives you goosebumps. HIghly recommended. But to get the full of it you should have a basic understanding of MCU. 10/10 for me."
2103,"May 6, 2019",9,"This movie gets nine and a half stars for anyone seeing all the mainstream Marvel films. It ties everything together so wonderfully. Such clever writing. Only a couple of small problems, clunkers added by Disney to sell their woke version of political correctness, but on every other level, extremely well done."
2104,"Aug 18, 2019",5,"I never did side with either DC or Marvel - even as a kid in the 1960's. There were superheroes I liked and ignored the rest. Now, while DC is showing us how poorly a film can be made (particularly ""Justice League""), Marvel has aced 60% of their 22 films to date in my opinion. I wish that was the case with this one. It not only underwhelmed me, it didn't serve it's predecessor well.I certainly don't fault the cast because outside the handful of main characters, the rest were merely background and foreground. After Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow, the rest of the cast were so many that they seemed like they were there for scenery. And like ""Justice League"", ""Avengers: Endgame"" suffered from the ""more is more"" syndrome that may please the under-10 crowd, but takes meaning away for us older viewers.Let's not overlook the cop-out remedy in science fiction these days - the reliance upon time travel to get out of a script jam. I realize it was a necessity in this particular chain of fictional events, but after a while it seems like (pardon the musical reference) a long, drawn-out guitar solo that has you wishing the band would get back to the song.This review isn't due to Thor (my favorite Marvel hero) growing fat and channeling his inner surfer dude, Tony Stark losing his life or Gamora 2.0 being the anti-Gamora. My regret is FOR the franchise instead of me as a viewer. They ended on a sad technical note due to unnecessary goings-on that I'm sure they worked very hard at trying to tie up in a movie.Another point that detracted from this film, and a few others in the Marvel cinematic universe is their social messaging. They didn't need to preach woman power because superheroes already have that built into their character. Here, it's shoved into our faces to signal their fashionable virtuosity. In other words, if there is a female superhero in a film, I don't need to be reminded that there's a sexual revolution going on here in reality. Theirs are formidable personas without need to be underscored.Using another musical analogy, this movie was like the members of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and The Who taking the stage at the same time and playing their sets. Apart, they're the best. Together, they're just noise. ""Avengers: Endgame"" would have been better if they pared down the scope, although I understand why they went the way they did. A franchise as successful as MCU set itself up for such a debacle. I'm grateful that it wasn't much, much worse.I thank those at Marvel for bringing to life the characters I read about in comic books at the corner store. They did a very good job overall."
2105,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"What a movie, Feels like an epic, once a lifetime!"
2106,"Mar 16, 2020",10,"Nope... i will say it's good, worth to watch. i dont care about the bad review because it's their feeling, but in my opinion this movie is good.at the final part, oh..its hard to explain my felling. But the important things is this movie is soooooo good"
2107,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"From a surprise starting ten minutes to great character development through to the best action with heart stopping events, this movie is amazing!! So many cheer worthy surprises & welcome developments,both the casual or diehard fan will be very happy."
2108,"Nov 12, 2024",8,"Avengers: Endgame was an experience unlike any other. As a long-time Marvel fan, I felt a palpable excitement in the air as I entered the theater. The anticipation was electric, and I could sense that everyone around me shared the same eagerness to see how this epic saga would conclude.From the very first moments, I was drawn into the emotional weight of the film. The opening scenes set a somber tone that resonated deeply, reminding us of the stakes and sacrifices made in Infinity War. I found myself completely immersed in the characters' journeys, feeling their pain, hope, and determination. The film beautifully balanced humor and heart, often catching me off guard with its comedic timing, especially from characters like Ant-Man and the Hulk. There were moments where I laughed out loud, only to be quickly brought back to tears as the story unfolded.The pacing, while a topic of debate among critics, felt deliberate to me. It allowed for character development and reflection, which I appreciated. Yes, there were a multitude of characters, and some had less screen time than I would have liked, but I felt that each one contributed to the larger narrative in meaningful ways. The film's ability to weave together so many storylines was impressive, and I found the emotional payoffs for long-time fans to be incredibly rewarding.Visually, Endgame was stunning. The epic battles were not just spectacles; they were moments that felt earned. The cinematography and special effects were top-notch, and the climactic showdown left me breathless. I remember sitting on the edge of my seat, heart racing, as I witnessed the culmination of over a decade of storytelling.What struck me the most was the film's ability to evoke nostalgia while also moving the story forward. The callbacks to earlier films were cleverly integrated, and I found myself grinning at the references that only true fans would fully appreciate. It was a love letter to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I felt honored to be part of the audience that had followed these characters through their ups and downs.As the credits rolled, I felt a wave of emotions wash over me-joy, sadness, and a sense of closure. It was a three-hour journey that didn't feel bloated at all; instead, it felt like a celebration of everything that had come before. I left the theater wanting to discuss every detail with my friends, reliving the moments that had moved us.In the end, Avengers: Endgame is not."
2109,"Apr 26, 2019",7,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has given us a lot of great characters and pulling of a final movie that uses all their unique abilities equally was always going to be a near impossible task. Endgame is proof of that. It didn't feel like the Avengers became a real team or learned much during these 22 movies. Their plans and tactics felt amateurish. I was hoping for something deeper and cleverer, but that never materialized. It was entertaining, well produced and acted, but for me it never got near masterpiece territory."
2110,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"I won't include any spoilers. I will say that Endgame fail flat with me. It was a good movie, but nothing close to Infinty Wars. There was no cohesion, the characters were not given that balanced screen time, the cleverness and timely humor wasn't there. The final battle scene was chaotic and didn't showcase enough of the Avengers talents, and what was shown was so fast paced it failed to make an impact. Even though it was a long movie, the entire thing felt rushed.I didn't at all like how they portrayed one of the heroes. And I didn't get a feel for the next generation of Avengers. In fact, of of the most constant icon fans of Marvel movies are used to isn't there.Also, I hated the music. I don't even remembere the famous Avengers theme song being played.There was also quite a bit of predictability with the movie. And there was some dumb things the characters did.Still, this is a must see for fans of the movies. The female empowerment thing carries over from Capt Marvel, but only somewhat. 7/10, and that's a weak 7."
2111,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"The movie is everything you want it to be and more. I was never bored in a single moment. The best part of the movie is watching them work and how they fit so much into a 3 hour movie which u would not want to miss a minute of. The movie opens with a subtle reference to infinity to spark ur memory of what happened at the end. The end made all 22 movies worth the watch and sets up the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe perfectly. You will happy, excited, and sad throughout the film. Without one of the best Marvel movies and best theater experience."
2112,"May 1, 2019",9,Wont spoil the movie for the public worth watching once...
2113,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Amazing (almost) end game fit the infinity phase of Avengers Movies. Several scenes brought mass applause and cheering throughout the movie. Love, love, loved the commitment to the MCU characters who started it all. I'm saying top 5 but my 12 year old son is giving it top 3 status. Will be adding to the box office gross to see this one in theaters again 👍💵😍"
2114,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Truly a breathtaking end to a saga that is so dear to all of usWith an ending that shakes my world You will not be disappointed with this conclusionThis is truly one of the best marvel has ever made
2115,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Epic Finale!If you just wait for the action scenes, better you watch The Raid, IP-Man or even UFC & WWE Smack Down. HAIL MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE!"
2116,"Apr 24, 2019",7,"Boring characters, boring dialogue, good plot. Very overly dramatic, and also a lot of annoying product placement."
2117,"Apr 30, 2019",3,Story line is not good..lots of plot hole...Forcely added emotional scene..Good part of movie is thanos..
2118,"Apr 25, 2019",8,First half of the movie is bit slow for marvel movie but it was made that way to bring story together.Second half of the movie was excellent. Had to agree that Russo brother are really good in providing a good closure to this franchise.
2119,"Apr 26, 2019",10,I'd say the perfect end for this series even if the ending is a little hard to take. There is a ton of action - well made CGI - not too many mistakes in logic and heartbreaking moments.I'll miss it waiting for a continue.If you don't see it the movie in cinema you'll not get the whole beauty of it.
2120,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Every one saying that it is bad is completely wrong. This is by far one of the best movie in the MCU and in the world.
2121,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Though it doesn't contain as many actions as Infinity War, it does have strong stories and perfection. This longest duration of Marvel's movie doesn't really feel that long, it flows in so great sequences, so emotionally. It's an epic closing of the assembled Avengers."
2122,"Apr 26, 2019",10,A worthy conclusion to 11 years of movies. A definite must see movie.
2123,"Apr 25, 2019",9,"I had higher expectations for the Endgames action, if you compare it with Infinity War, but plot did focus more on the characters. Lots of funny scenes in the movie as always. Only concern i left the cinema with a few questions, sure they will be answered soon after most have watched it. It's a 3 hours movie that doesn't make you feel like watching 3 hours, even if it would go 3,5 hours or more you would still sitting and watch it and time would flow away. But the feeling you get in the end is that an Era came to it's end."
2124,"Oct 7, 2019",6,"It also has several plot-holes... They need to hire better script writers, since plot-holes like this are very easily avoided, yet they can ruin an entire franchise's continuity (which is exactly what has happened here).Thanos snapped away half of all people right? To solve overpopulation right? Because his planet & people suffered from overpopulation right? SO WHY THE HELL would he then do what he did with the stones, in just a few generations the population of the galaxy will be back where it was and more overpopulated than ever? It's the most stupid plot hole ever.Another HUGE plot-hole: There's NO WAY that a human could wield a single Infinity Stone, never mind all of them at once so that blows a huge hole in the whole last 30minutes of the movie and all future movies, since what happened is impossible. A human would die instantly if they wielded that much power.Hire better damn writers!"
2125,"May 1, 2019",3,Expected more much more as a fan I have continue sly fallowed the franchise wanted a better way of story telling much better story line it felt like every world from different song in a same album glued together in the worst way possible
2126,"May 6, 2019",10,"When Brie Larson arrived on Earth at the end of Captain Marvel she found the remains of Nick Fury's Avengers, the survivors of Josh Brolin's Thanos and his Infinity Stones grab. In Marvel Avengers: Endgame the Russo Brothers must band together this smaller group of superheroes to find Thanos, retrieve the Infinity Stones, and bring back their fallen comrades. The stones must then be returned to their original time in the past. Easy we might imagine in a film with a 181 minutes running time. I saw it opening day but you won't notice the length as it moves at warp speed.We can see who survived Infinity War from the poster, and thanks to Captain Marvel she brings Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark back to Earth after his fight with Thanos, with Karen Gillan's Nebula and Bradley Cooper's Rocket, into Gwyneth Paltrow's waiting arms. But there's no time to reminisce as Nebula knows where her father was going after Infinity War. But having achieved his aim Thanos destroyed all the stones.And with no way to bring back the 50% of the population destroyed, five years later our superheroes have found either domestic bliss, as in Pepper and Tony, Chris Evans's Steve Rogers is running grief counselling sessions, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow and Don Cheadle's War Machine are running the depleted office and well Hawkeye is really really angry about losing all his family and in Japan taking out gangsters. Jeremy Renner never got an answer to his mustard or mayonnaise question.Then one day an inquisitive rat presses a button in an old van and we get Paul Rudd's Ant-Man back. And he's a little surprised as to what the hell happened in the last 5 hours he spent inside the quantum realm. And given that time is altered in the quantum realm, maybe our superheroes could travel back to collect all the stones and click their own fingers to bring everyone back. But Tony Stark isn't interested, he has his own family and doesn't want to change time. So maybe another brain might be able to create the quantum tunnel. A really big brain. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk has embraced his green side and is happy to take selfies with kids. And while I read of the year long training and diet that Scarlett Johansson followed for the back-to-back filming of both Infinity War and Endgame, well Chris Hemsworth's Thor has really let it all hang out. He got it easy this year. Nice to see Taika Waititi back as Korg. But having already done his bit with Thanos, Thor is quite happy drinking in the Asgardians' new homeland.And yet Tony Stark cannot quite stop thinking about a trip Back to the Future. And is even more amazed when his testing actually proves it is possible.So that's six stones to find; Time, Mind, Space, Reality, Power and Soul, and only one chance for each of the remaining Avengers to find them, and return, with their limited vials of Hank Pym's serum. Not everyone will survive as they split up to find the stones. But what great stories they'll have to tell about their adventures in the past. Although someone has discovered what our superheroes are up to. And he's coming.I've been following the Marvel Avengers films, and the Marvel Agents of Shield tv series for a long time now, and Endgame is a fitting climax. Cramming everyone from Marvel into the story line was no mean feat for the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, but I think everyone made it, even with the blink and you maybe miss them scenes. But the You and Whose Army was mind blowing. Could Captain Marvel have done it all herself I wondered, maybe, but where's the fun in that, anyway she cannot turn back time, and the Avengers have always been a team. Even when they fell out and had civil wars.With a rumoured budget of $400million the film was a hit the first weekend. Great fun and if you didn't enjoy it you don't have a pulse. Was it the final scene for Stan Lee though?"
2127,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Saw Endgame twice yesterday! The action, the humour, the drama, the emotions are off the charts! Epic doesn't even comes close when talking about this Marvel of a superhero movie! Avengers Assemble!"
2128,"Sep 24, 2019",10,Great movie. I wonder where such great heroes live who rescue humanity? In real world I couldn't find help to rescue myself from torture for last 15 years
2129,"May 4, 2019",8,"Echoing what many other reviews said, this was one of the few pop culture behemoths that lived up to its' hype... This was a fantastic conclusion to a wonderful 10 years of cinema from MARVEL (my only minute criticism would be that during multiple emotional scenes where crying was involved, I didn't see any tears -__-... But that's just me nit picking)"
2130,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"Lets be truly honest, it's ok, it's too long, see it once....and many things are just too absurd ... Thor's storyline for one. Nebula's story line for two.Acting was fine. Everyone was fine. But you'd think for a three hour movie there would be more inter-Avenger dialog, especially between Natasha and Cap and Clint and Banner because she's attempted relationships with all three and now that half the people are gone and she cries a lot don't you think any of the other three would want to have a relationship?Frankly Infinity War was at least as good."
2131,"May 8, 2019",6,Prefer movies like interstellar than this. Done with Avengers.
2132,"Apr 29, 2019",4,"If you've been loving the MCU films recently, then this will probably be your favorite one yet. It's absolutely jammed packed with material, and the more MCU films you've seen, the better it'll be.However, the movie is dragged down by an extensive runtime, and jokes that miss the mark. Endgame takes too long to get going, and then seemingly never ends. And most of the humor is hit or miss; it just feels out of place.Overall, Endgame wraps up the Avengers ark reasonably well, but it's too arrogant and lacks any real sense of quality."
2133,"Apr 28, 2019",9,"Although this film way not be the all out action that some may want or expect it is so much more than that, so many story lines are finished, set up to be continued and others are just starting... Marvel really have done this franchise and themselves huge justice! The payout from this film is so worth it and if you don't shed a tear at any point of this film then you simple aren't human, raw emotion. MUST WATCH if you are even a casual marvel/avengers fan!"
2134,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame is simply the best movie ever created in the entire cinematic history. Best. If there is any word stronger than that, I would have no hesitation in using it. Everything about it can only be rivalled by very few movies. People will be talking about this movie tomorrow, the day after, next month, next year, in 10 years, in 100 years as the best thing humankind has ever made. We have made history here today and we will not stop until we are satisfied."
2135,"May 5, 2022",8,"Avengers: Endgame is complicated, yet satisfactory. It has issues, but hits key goals. First, Endgame explores the aftermath of Infinity War, solidifying its impact and earning the ensuing redemption. Next, the time heist is convenient, but effectively reflects on the franchise and develops core characters. Lastly, the finale is excessive, but that's what the masses want. Plus, its prelude fight between Thanos and the three core Avengers is exciting. Power levels are inconsistent, the climax gets desensitizing, and the plot is clunky, but Endgame finishes with emotional closure. Because drama is strategically emphasized, Endgame ultimately overcomes its flaws.Technically, Endgame isn't as cohesive as Infinity War, but still succeeds. Visually, there are extended shots, overheads, and conscious composition. The editing is cumbersome, but manages a massive scope. The sound isn't as symbolic and the music isn't as restrained, but both still contribute. Meanwhile, the production design of the finale is noticeably colorless. This was likely an attempt at a gritty atmosphere, but it's mostly just unsightly. However, the effects are extensive (though CGI heavy) and the cast is amazing. Plus, the acting is touching. Overall, it's a downgrade from Infinity War, but Endgame still offers plenty.Writing: 7/10 Direction: 7/10 Cinematography: 7/10 Acting: 8/10 Editing: 7/10 Sound: 8/10 Score/Soundtrack: 8/10 Production Design: 8/10 Casting: 10/10 Effects: 8/10Overall Score: 7.8/10."
2136,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"Avengers: Endgame is truly one of those films marketed to satisfy hardcore fans. Watching this film I truly wished that I was one of those fans and could receive the amount of satisfaction that they all seemed to have received from this.As an outsider I feel like a lot of the humor was misplaced, a lot of the action scenes were dark and hard to see, a high level of predictability to the film, a loss of logic in a few of the plot lines and a really unforgiving run time. Also given that this movie has a lot of characters in it, there really is a big difference in some of their screen time and not in a good way.Putting that all aside though there were some really good scenes, some of the jokes were hilarious and the overwhelming emotion of seeing all the Avengers from over the years finally assemble and give evil a true kick in the face was amazing to see.I would definitely recommend seeing the film to form your own opinion and I am definitely glad that the creators gave their fans exactly what they wanted in this ending, as I would like the same sense of loyalty given to me for the saga's that I am I hardcore fan of."
2137,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Drama action and everything was great Gonna watch it again
2138,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"The plot hole bothers me so much, and the last year is better than this one"
2139,"Apr 26, 2019",8,"I just want to say thank to Marvel for an epic 11 years and for an epic conclusion. Thank you Stan Lee, Kevin Feige, Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, RDJ, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, and all the other superheroes for this epic adventure! A job well done!"
2140,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Yessssssssssssssssss this is the movie of the century
2141,"May 1, 2019",10,"Great comeback after infinity war. Bring all the dust back to life. Great story line, laughs, cry, claps all the audience. Great cinematic experience... love love love. Thank you for another great movie"
2142,"May 18, 2019",10,Can't imagine better scenario than this one..unbelievable
2143,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Before watching Endgame, I had doubts it will not be better than Infinity war. but it's not, the movie is tremendously good, emotionally and fantastic. everything from the first moment to the final scene is perfectly made. I wished those 3 hours never end. I enjoyed every single moment of this beautiful saga, Thanks MCU for the amazing dreams that we lived in such fascinating world."
2144,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"Although I expected much more from this movie, it is still satisfying for me and a decent finale to the avengers series. The movie starts with showing you how the snap affected one of the heroes life. then followed by the remaining avengers trying to protect the remainig world by fighting crime normally as they were doing before Thanos's time. After losing all hope, Ant-man finally returns to the avengers and introduces an idea that might actually work, but one that he can't carry out himself. This leads to the reunion of the avengers team which will spark events that will change the MCU forever. The pacing of the events is not quiet thorough and some prolonged dramatic scenes fall apart and make you feel bored instead of sad. Also the most exciting and effective parts are all packed in the last hour. one of the technical aspects that I did not like was the blurry transition, the camera takes a long time to focus on a character or un-focus from a scene and move on to the next, which really hurt my eye in the IMAX theater. but overall, it was a nice experience and you shouldn't miss this one, infinity war is still the best MCU movie for me but endgame is among the greatest in the series."
2145,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"I have watched and enjoyed all the movies leading up to this one, over the past decade, however I left slightly disappointed with Endgame.Personally, I thought it didn't live up to the hype.I was particularly disappointed with Captain Marvel's screen-time, given the power she possesses."
2146,"May 1, 2019",1,"Is the movie entertaning? sure. is the movie good? nope. It's actually one of the weakest mcu movies. maybe even worse than black panther and spiderman. and those 2 were really bad.so basically, a rat saved the day. Not Hulk, not tony stark but a rat. oh, and time travel. it's like they wrote the scenario in 1 day, in rehab.It's a pitty that after Infinity War, which was awesome, we got this dissapointing finale.9 stars? lol."
2147,"Apr 20, 2020",9,"This film is incredible!!! I do dislike Captain Marvel, here character is ridiculously over-powered to the point she makes the GOD of thunder look weak. However, she is barely in the film and I'm glad it focuses the OG avengers high-lighting their personal sacrifice and struggle in the fight against tyranny. This film effectively ties some loose ends with an impressive attention to detail but still leaves space for the Marvel universe to continue to grow and continue to brighten our lives. You could only dislike this film if you have no investment in the previous 21."
2148,"Oct 16, 2023",10,"Avengers: Endgame is the epic culmination of the Infinity Saga, and it certainly lives up to the hype. Marvel has once again demonstrated its prowess in storytelling, seamlessly weaving together a tapestry of characters and narratives. The film's meticulous planning and execution showcase Marvel's mastery in the superhero genre. The Infinity Saga has undeniably been a remarkable journey, proving that the time invested was absolutely worth it. Marvel has not just created movies; they've crafted a cinematic universe that is both marvelous and brilliant. Endgame leaves us eagerly anticipating the next chapter, hopeful that Marvel will continue to deliver the same level of magic in the upcoming saga."
2149,"May 6, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame is no doubt the best film in the galaxy. Avengers: Endgame is full of action, sadness and also thrill. I sat in a cinema for 3 hours and a half and have never enjoyed 3 hours more. It is so much better than Infinity War and I am going to see it for a second time lol..."
2150,"Apr 27, 2019",8,"I'm not going to spoil anything. Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but those 2 first hours... So many plot holes. If you're someone with a minimum of logic and appreciate intelligent writing, chances are you'll get mad a couple times in the first 2 acts. However, that last hour was THE best segment I have ever scene in a superhero movie. It was really epic and everything you probably hoped for. It really saved the movie and boosted my rating. The rest of the movie would've been a 6-7 in my opinion. It's definitely not the best MCU movie like some hardcore fans are pretending it to be, but you still have to see the movie. The conclusion is very satisfying! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer. I even had goosebumbs at one point, and I'm not even a HUGE fan of the MCU. It's a must see. Enjoy!"
2151,"May 15, 2019",10,"As the continuation of the ""Avangers: Infinity War"" movie, this film was successful to make the audience feel very curious about the end of the story. This film tests whether you are really Marvelous or not. When you watch this film, you will feel every second of this film is a pity to miss. Three hours duration of this film feels nothing for me, even I wish it could be a little longer.A continuous story from previous films makes this film very interesting to watch and also difficult to predict the end of this film. Anyone who might miss the previous Marvel films related to this film might not understand the parts related to this ""Avengers: Endgame"" film. I think the camera and sound effects is perfect. Each of actor and artist successfully plays the hero character entrusted to them very well.A good teamwork is very highlighted in this film. This film teaches that the optimism in achieving a goal, even though it must pass a big challenge. When I watch this film, I feel touched by the struggle and the sacrifice made by the team. Every scene from this film has its own meaning, even It's not hesitate to shed tears for some sad scenes. I want to watch this movie again and again because i just want to say that this is one of the best Marvel films. If possible, I want to give 11/10 rate for this amazing film."
2152,"May 2, 2019",6,"There are no spoilers needed to back up the statement that 'Endgame' is the Swiss cheese of the bunch as far as plot holes and internal contradictions are concerned. Emotionally strong and visually impressive, it's one of the most entertaining movies in the MCU and cannot be missed by anyone who watched most of the others.But unless you are already deeply invested in the MCU or simply have to know ""what's next"" after the (actually far better) 'Inifity War', or you're just here for the fights, tear jerks and explosions, this movie is entirely missable. You will be passing up the opportunity to endlessly pick it apart with your geek friends though, who will spend the next decade trying to come up with excuses to make this movie work.It *is* after all the culmination of a decade of storytelling and it deserves credit for pulling that off. It's a shame that a movie that does such a good job of connecting everything, making it look so good, with so much star power, ends up being a plot mess and honestly lazy."
2153,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Best superhero movie ever period. The way they have directed the movie is too damn good. It was sad, funny and absolutely brilliant."
2154,"Apr 30, 2019",7,"Let me preface this by saying that I definitely belong in the ""casual Marvel fan"" category; so feel free to take this with a grain of salt.I liked watching ""Endgame"". It was clearly the more emotional of the Infinity saga, the villain was better handled, and there were times when I was firmly butt-in-seat for whatever came next. Did it need to crash the 3-minute threshold? Good lord, no! I never glanced at my watch (which I guess says something) but it's not without its draggy segments. And as much as I wanted the team to get back at the bad guy and make things right, I was more interested in the time-travel, fan service and movie-hopping than I was in the big battle scene.Don't get me wrong; I know this is a milestone. Ten years' worth of franchise-building capped in one movie; filling the imposing shoes of vanquishing Thanos; raking in a billion dollars. It was less escapism for me than it was witnessing history in the making. That much was palpable. And this a good movie, but it's hard to say if it lives up the unbelievable hype.For me, it's questionable."
2155,"May 26, 2019",1,"Thought it was boring, can't remember anything I liked about it. Only went cuz a friend said it was good, reminded me a bit of Harry Potter."
2156,"Apr 25, 2019",9,"That was the greatest ending that was made for that world which started 11 years ago by making it so great and powerfulAfter losing by Thanos in Infinity war the whole team is starting to get them selfes ready by getting Captain Marvel to their team to defeat him and get every body disappeared again so what will they do ? Every body wanted to know what was going to happen after the ending of infity war Actually they made it great really great with powerful story that got every small and big thing from marvel universe with 3 hours ! That's unbelievable to get to know it ,it got every character that created the universe by a great way to end the game by it's suitable wayBy the performances everybody did a great job that did what they supposed to do in every scene was created I can say that the best acting in the movie was done by Robert Downy Jr The Visual effects were great with no any negative point in it,the sound system was good and I felt it in the theater,every simple thing that was supposed to be good was there and thanks to the Russos for getting every thing really greatThe movie you should see it go see it as hard as you can if you're a great fan to marvel and if your not you can also go and believe me you're gonna see every thing can be made in any movie there gonna be action,comedy, great scenario I hope he get a chance by nominating it in the adapted screenplay next Oscars as Logan did,great acting,real drama,so many claps you will do if you're communicating will with watching the movie What you see about the movie with no spoiling if you saw it"
2157,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Alright, who am I kidding, even that is an understatement. There's just no words to describe it. It is so engaging and enthralling from the very beginning to the end. And for a Marvel Fan, there's not and could never be an experience quite like it. Even if you use all the good adjectives to describe it, that won't be enough! It is going to stay close to my heart for all eternity."
2158,"Apr 26, 2019",10,It is very difficult to put in words how you will feel after seeing this movie; but you must. It is absolutely perfection.
2159,"Apr 26, 2019",6,Entertaining action and certainly comical interaction between characters but a disappointingly predictable culmination of many years and many movies.
2160,"Sep 13, 2019",9,"Wow, this film is a superb culmination of every single Avengers film. You possibly could've seen more of Captain Marvel but seeing as she's a late edition it didn't seem that out of place.I was amazed with the preemptive thought that went into this final edition. Every scene that passed, I had to take a breath, everything seemed to gel effortlessly, although at the same time seemed complicated. The film is a masterclass and I'm gutted, but as they say, all good things come to an end......"
2161,"May 6, 2019",1,When you kill off two of the main characters the ones that weren't sjw and promote social Warrior BS I'm done. This was my end game don't waste your money your time those are two things it's hard to get back. And some sisters in the Marvel Universe none of us can go back in time what a joke.
2162,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Marvell had a challenge to finish a great 11-year stage and 22 films that had a great viewing experience may have some small mistakes. I expected more than some characters. But I'm happy at this end I do not expect it could have been better deserves 10/10 because it was a big challenge and has won the challenge It should not be compared with less effortless films Do not direct this great challenge and should not be compared with the infinity war because this film is a complement to the film The Infinite War
2163,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"What I was thinking all this time of how this movie will be, it completely amazed me because it was really beyond my thoughts and I'm sure for many of you guys,(but not all) of what you had been predicted, it has all the emotions in this movie. It has a lot of sadness from the beginning and it was very funny also, a very great action which was an epic one(very unique)and adventurous too.most importantly it has really gave a shock about it, not one time but several times and it has really touched my heart, prepare for it because there's lot of sorrows, pain, comedy, shocking moments and it was worth of crying a lot. When I was watching this, it gave a lots of goosebumps too most of the time and every part of the movie, very minute was special and precious.It deserves to have a rating on 10/10.When you'll finish to watch it you will want for the fifth one as it deserves to have an another one because I can't believe that it's the last one and it really have ended. The last thing that I want to say for those who has not yet seen the movie is prepare yourself, keep your eyes big open,(don't look down when you're eating or anywhere else and don't blink too much) hold your applause and most importantly keep your excitement in silence because there will be a lot of unimaginable moments of which you couldn't believe. Please enjoy the movie to the fullest of your life.For me it's the greatest film of all time and for me it has already shattered all records and I guess for many of you also.The graphics and quality was really awesome as it was a little more superior than the infinity war and the actions too was really glorious and incredibly done, was astonished to see that.There will be some moments where you will be like freezing and and trembling too.So thank you and once again for the epic word, ""Whatever it takes"".Glory to the Avengers and may it be the one and only that nobody can break its record.Thank you once again"
2164,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"One word review , MARVELOUS. The ending made all cry, but I think it was for good. A happy farewell to all our beloved superheroes."
2165,"Apr 26, 2019",9,"When Infinity War ended... I was desperate to find out what happens next. After a long year of waiting, Endgame is finally out for the whole world to experience. I can honestly say from start to finish it was a fantastic thrill ride, you could tell the whole cinema audience was Morphed into the Marvel Universe from the get go.I would highly recommend watching this film while it is out in cinema.. Why you still reading this.. go and book a ticket, enjoy!"
2166,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"Infinity war is way way way better than end game.i didn't like the story that much. expected much more, i am not satisfied."
2167,"Sep 10, 2023",10,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is an epic culmination of over a decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe storytelling. Released in 2019, it brought an end to the Infinity Saga and left a lasting impact on both fans and the film industry.The film masterfully weaves together numerous character arcs and storylines, providing closure for beloved heroes while introducing new twists and surprises. The performances from the ensemble cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Josh Brolin, are outstanding, delivering emotional depth and humor.The action sequences are spectacular, with breathtaking visuals and a thrilling final battle that's a cinematic achievement.

2168,"Apr 27, 2019",9,Go watch it won't reveal much. It's very well done.
2169,"May 16, 2022",10,"It started back in 2008 with Ironman. And about 20 movies after that, phase 3 of the MCU ends with Endgame. And what an end it is! Goosebumps everytime I see the portals scene. Thank you!Haters take a chill-pill and try not to choke on it..."
2170,"May 4, 2019",8,"Just watched this in cinema today and i'm not disappointed. First few minutes were slow, but it gets very intriguing after that. Most of the action scenes come towards the end of the movie and they were very good, but I wish it had more or lasted longer. I felt the story was good and made sense, but there's probably some cliches or plot holes that I don't know about lol. It's a good movie, not the greatest movie ever like some people say, that's The Shawshank Redemption for me, but it's still one of the best action movies and worth a watch."
2171,"Jan 19, 2022",10,"Back in 2008, Marvel released the wonderful blockbuster 'Iron Man' and ushered in a new era of the comic book universe. Then no one could have imagined that the story would take on such a scale.For several long years, Marvel Studios has been moving towards the final act, delaying the battle with the main villain Thanos, thereby intriguing the audience more and more. Here comes the 22nd Avengers: Endgame movie of 2019. It's sad to realize that this is really the ending of the Avengers, because I loved them so much ... It was also sad to realize the ending of the film, which must have touched most Marvel fans. When watching, I was overwhelmed with many different emotions, but mostly it was sadness, which sometimes resulted in tears, but not without tears of joy. In general, I am a rather emotional person, so I have always liked such films.I can say that the Marvel studio does not change its interests and also shoot everything in colorful colors, which is very attractive. Also, their main feature has always been charismatic actors, where everyone is unique in their own way. And I liked the fact that in this part they collected all the superheroes from the Marvel universe. It's really incredible to see them all together!"
2172,"Apr 28, 2019",8,"Best movie Its include all satisfied ending for all characters, which are doing 11 year hard work on it but in movie not justified on stronger base characters halk & thor..... Anyway movie more EMOTIONAL as compare to action...... So Enjoy movie & hurry before anyone spoil"
2173,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"The movie makes you laugh, cry, and walk out filling fulfilled. Watching every movie, going on the rollercoaster with them. One that every marvel fan should enjoy!!!!"
2174,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"Loved infinity war and hoped end game would be close but ended up very disappointed. The movie started off strong then felt slow for the next 2 hours. While the movie did end on a good note, the plot overall felt very lazy and was filled with plot holes. The few great moments make the movie worth it but definitely not in the elite superhero movies for me"
2175,"May 6, 2019",9,"I dont know what to say about the movie because if I consider it as the last movie, it might be a better end. however actually it is not an end it was a good opportunity for the desired changeover. and they did this very well. Russo's and Feige did not miss this great opportunity and got the chance to create a newer and more well-balanced cinematic universe. Thank you guys for everything. LOVE YOU"
2176,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"After watching Infinity War, the bar was set super high. I was scared that Endgame couldn't reach the same level, but it went even higher. Love it times 3000."
2177,"May 3, 2019",9,"This is the first and foremost english movie which i've/we've watched the opening show in the morning at 5am. As it marks the end of the decade long marvel collection of movies, we were very much thrilled to watch the movie asap, but still we got tickets only on the next day. It was definitely one of the fascinating experience as the movie was filled with so many things like time travel, actions, emotions, suspense, it is definitely the most anticipated movie as everybody knows but the fact that it still manages to entertain is where the movie makers excel, hats off to pull off such a massive thing. But making my favourite Iron Man disappear in the end was unexpected and long lasting. In tamil Vijay Sethupathis' voice was just set into our sub conscious very well so it didn't set too much to the movie from the point of view of general audience like us."
2178,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Man this movie is just awesome. Its funny , full of action and emotional hell lot of emotion. Booked 1st show of the day and can't get it out a my head. Surely Marvel doesn't disappoint ( never). Its a proper justice to Avengers Franchise."
2179,"Apr 25, 2019",7,"I have to say that Endgame was enjoyable, albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons, yet this is to be expected when all the MCU is combined into this strange conclusion. The performances are very good, although one is left wondering what the point of introducing Captain Marvel was due to her lack of actual contribution to ""the grand plan"". I firmly believe that this could have been done better by postponing its release or splitting it into more parts so that the pacing, the tone and at times even the story wouldn't be so all over the place. However, I am glad to have seen the conclusion of the franchise and hopefully Marvel will continue to deliver great movies in the future."
2180,"Apr 24, 2019",7,"Objectively it's a decent movie. But as someone who was simply BLOWN away by Infinity War. This movie just left me plain confused. There are so many giant plot holes. The script seems rushed. Not well planned out. And maybe the term ""snooze fest"" is a bit harsh. But the movie builds up really slow. Only to reach a point that is very predictable. For me, just too bad for it's potential."
2181,"Nov 15, 2020",1,Some super like heroes try to hit and kick each other for about three hours. That's it. I really don't understand why people loves movies like this.
2182,"Apr 28, 2019",10,Extremely well done. Wraps up all the character arcs with a bow on top. Numerous character crossovers from every MCU film. Similar to the series finale of Star trek the next generation in some ways.
2183,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"I'm not going to include any spoilers, I'm just going to say: if you're a MCU fan and have enjoyed what Feig et al have achieved so far, WATCH THIS MOVIE. It is breathtaking, the perfect dénouement for Phase 3. Bravo Team MCU. 👍"
2184,"Sep 13, 2019",10,"GENERAL CONSENSUS (BAD, OK, GOOD, EXCELLENT): Excellent film and very good ending to the Tony Stark Marvel Era Saga."
2185,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Avenger endgame is one of the best movie , I have ever seen. It is a power combo pack of friends love, sacrifies and determination for goal. I don't believe that Avenger end game would be require any change because it is perfectly directed and and no errors."
2186,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"In 3 hours (not like 3, movie isn't boring. like 2 hours) i've cried and laughed a lot. this movie is the best superhero movie ever. and i think they won't do the better than this once..."
2187,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This film was perfect, what an amazingly emotional way to sign off phase 3 and I am sure stan Lee would of been extremely happy with.As I grown man I don't cry at much but this film made me cry on numerous times. Both happy and sad tears fell down my face. Truly a master class movie!!"
2188,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"The title says it all. Plus this movie had toooo manyy flaws, which I am totally willing to ignore. Which movie does not?But clearly they should have at least taken some more time and get their stories in sync and correct."
2189,"Apr 24, 2019",10,Perfect ending but still bit emotional. I would say 11/10..must watch it. Hats off RDJr.
2190,"Apr 26, 2019",9,The Russo brothers knocked one out of the park with this movie! Sign them up for movies within the Star Wars franchise. Marvel tied a beautiful bow with this movie in order to wrap up the Avengers series.
2191,"May 7, 2019",9,"Final fight scene is the one of the best action scenes ever.Movie is funny, emotionally driven film ❤"
2192,"Nov 30, 2019",8,"I am a fan of The Avengers movie series, and I've watched every one of 'em. And I like them all."
2193,"Apr 27, 2019",10,I thought this was the perfect way to end the game. This movie is the best of all the Marvel movies and is emotional and funny at the same time. It was a great ending to the era and a movie you won't regret seeing.
2194,"May 13, 2019",6,"My son and I Loved infinity war 10 stars, great plot and character interaction, this one felt lacking in both. I'm glad others like it though, my kid who is 7 fell asleep 💤 at 1 hour, he asked me 40 mins in if it gets more interesting . When he awoke an hour later my answer was yes, but not much. Loved Captain America and the hammer, movie tingles in that scene. He might rate it lower?"
2195,"Mar 28, 2021",1,"I hate it. Makers just have to make money, they make this worse in MCU and all superhero movies universe."
2196,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Even though in a country like Afghanistan no one is interested in movies and no one is a movie lover but I am MCU made a movie lover specially Iron Man but Endgame was the best movie I have ever seen. while seeing Stark tears were coming from my eyes for the first time avengers endgame is.....
2197,"Oct 15, 2019",9,"Here is my spoiler free review, I often like to discuss the negatives of a movie before the positives so here goes.I didn't quite enjoy Endgame as much the first time around since I had been spoiled about significant events in the film and it does suffer from quite a few plot holes. Some events aren't explained quite enough and require a good bit of mental gymnastics to hurdle. My main complaint like many others, despite not having much screen time, is Brie Larson (more on that later). Captain Marvel's movie, of which I do share the popular dislike for, was released barely over a month before Endgame. This is important because she is quite arrogant and emotionless in Endgame, a popular argument being Tony Stark is quite arrogant also, however we have had over a decade and 10 movies to watch and understand Stark's backstory and why he is this way, Captain Marvel not so much. I do however give Brie Larson the benefit of the doubt, after seeing how she is in interviews and such, I do believe the blame here lies with the directors. Larson and Marvel seem like completely different people. Her appearance is downgraded later in the movie too. There's also a scene with Fortnite.. which of course speaks for itself.All of the above is why I simply cannot give it a 10, one may think how can so many negatives only deduct 1 from a perfect score? Well, staying true to a spoiler free review that is quite the task to explain of course.As with any avid fan like myself and having watched Iron Man in cinemas 11 years ago, here we are 22 movies later and there isn't much more I could've asked for. Lot's of previous questions answered, closure brought to many story-lines, many epic moments and surprises. Had the franchise not been so long until this point, my rating most likely would've been 7.5. Somebody that has watched all previous instalments will appreciate Endgames nods at it's predecessors, lots of rewards for longtime fans. Is it as good as Infinity War? Not quite, it does shortly follow however, up there with my favourites IW, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man. A must watch for any Marvel fan. There are however still unanswered questions as with any MCU movie, which will most likely be answered in the upcoming titles.TLDR: Slightly political, plot holes and an undesirable character that ultimately get's trumped by the excellence of the other 95%"
2198,"Apr 11, 2023",9,"Five years after Thanos (Josh Brolin) wiped out half of all life in the Universe and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) killed Thanos in rage after learning Thanos had destroyed the Infinity Stones, Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) re-emerges from the Quantum Realm after having been trapped their 5 years earlier but not having aged a day. With the Avengers now a shadow of the organization it once was, many of the heroes have since gone their separate ways. However Scott Lang believes they could undo Thanos' plan by traveling through time in the Quantum realm.The concluding chapter of the MCU's Infinity Saga, Avengers: Endgame was shot back-to-back with the same team as Avengers: Infinity War and like Infinity War was one of the most expensive movies ever made with a $400 million budget. Upon release the film broke box office records with a worldwide opening of $1.2 billion before eventually reaching just under $2.8 billion in its final tally, briefly eclipsing Avatar as the highest grossing film of all time (not adjusted for inflation) until Avatar's Chinese re-release. Much like Infinity War, Endgame is epic in both scope and scale touching on every aspect and character of the MCU sending off several characters and developing and building many others.As with Infinity War, Endgame keeps itself pretty simple in terms of its plot with the main focus and drama coming from the characters and their interactions with one another. The opening act that sees Scott Lang re-emerge in the MCU after five years have passed since Thanos enacted his plan nicely build off the often homaged and referenced ending of Infinity War wherein several prominent characters and half of the Universe's population were blinked out of existence. As this is the same team that gave us the second and third Captain America films as well as Infinity War, it should surprise no one that despite handling a large cast every character feels like they're given their due in both character and action. The time travel aspect is nicely incorporated with the audience getting to see several big moments in the MCU from another angle and even characters who were written off get a second chance to appear. Some of the creative decisions I'm not quite sure how I felt about (particularly in regards to an element of the Guardians of the Galaxy felt like it was reset back to zero) but for every moment that didn't land, there were several that did.Avengers: Endgame isn't quite as good as the setup in Infinity War, but in terms of concluding chapters for film series especially when taking into account the large number of movies setup over an 11 year period this is probably about as good as it gets."
2199,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"To avoid any more suggestion of spoilers, I'll say this - the cast, cinematography, story - it's all well done. And if this is the last Marvel ever made, it would be the most fitting and perfect of endings. It does have a few minor flaws in its story, but with so many moving parts in this three hour epic (that is shockingly self-contained), you can forgive it for its awesomeness."
2200,"Dec 28, 2019",9,"This was an excellent storyline, i did not care for some of the larts in tye series, some which did not make much sense but still not a bad movie to watch."
2201,"May 19, 2019",10,Funny. Lovely. Action. Epic and at the same time full of meaning. Everything is going perfect
2202,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"No spoilers here, but...wow. Some have said they weren't happy with the conclusion, but I thought it fit (no matter how many tears it brings!)."
2203,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"While superhero movies aren't all known for deep plots or very substantial storytelling, Endgame falls far off the Avenger's franchise and feels way too long and underwhelming. The tone of the movie is stripped down by the long shots and unnecessary plot devices, which are predictable and is a forced way to make spectators feel like it's a satisfying ending, which it definitely isn't. While some characters do get a somehwat satisfying closing, the story feels dull and without the excitement that prompted the other movies until now, every scene is stretched for far longer than it should, the editing isn't condensanding, and while one of the biggest points in Infinity war was the various events happening at the same time, this movie does exactly the opposite, it feels, overall, disappointing. It's not a horrible movie, but not even close to one of Marvel's bests and that's what's most disappointing about it, because it feels like an ending, but not like a closure."
2204,"Aug 10, 2019",1,"I can never be bothered with reviews but this films rating is beyond a joke. Plot is awkward and ridiculous... even for Marvel. Acting is non existent. Direction and editing just feels amateurish. I couldnt deal with anymore after the 1st hour it was excruciating. It feels like they gave a class of children the old ""how would you end the avengers"" lesson and just put all the answers in a bag and picked one.... and then just made it work.... or so they thought. I may feels the urge to watch the 1st half again and hope it inspires me to watch the conclusion but its highly doubtful."
2205,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"This film is the collectiveness of so many characters, memories and emotions. You cant simply make this. It is everything I'd hoped and prayed it would be.Marvel you have truly out done yourselves.Thank you"
2206,"Apr 26, 2019",10,In just few words I want to give the review about film. As a diehard marvel fan you'll be really proud to be MCU fan. What an epic conclusion to the 22 films! This is the kind of film that after repeated watching you'll get that same deep satisfaction you get on the 1st time watching.
2207,"May 19, 2019",10,Funny-lovely-action-epic and at the same full of meaning.everyone is doing perfect
2208,"Jun 14, 2024",10,"**Avengers: Endgame (2019) - A Culmination of a Cinematic Journey**The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) reached an apex with ""Avengers: Endgame,"" a film that not only serves as a sequel to the cataclysmic ""Avengers: Infinity War"" but also as the conclusion of a saga that has spanned over a decade and 22 films. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, ""Endgame"" is a monumental achievement in modern filmmaking, balancing a sprawling ensemble cast, intricate plotlines, and emotional depth, all while delivering the high-octane action fans expect.Picking up in the aftermath of Thanos' snap, which wiped out half of all life in the universe, ""Endgame"" explores the grief and determination of the surviving Avengers. The world is in ruins, and the heroes are left grappling with their failure and loss. This sense of despair is palpable, setting a somber tone that contrasts sharply with the vibrant, often lighthearted nature of earlier MCU entries. The film does not shy away from showing the psychological scars left on its characters, from Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) retreat into domestic life and Captain America's (Chris Evans) struggle to lead a support group, to Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) descent into depression and self-loathing.The plot kicks into high gear when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), also known as Ant-Man, escapes from the quantum realm and presents the possibility of time travel as a means to undo Thanos' snap. This sets the stage for a heist-like adventure that sees the Avengers traveling to various points in their past, revisiting key moments from previous films. This clever narrative device allows for a rich exploration of the series' history, providing fans with nostalgic callbacks and a deeper understanding of the characters' journeys.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its ability to juggle its extensive cast, giving each character meaningful moments and arcs. The original six Avengers-Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner)-are given particular focus, honoring their contributions to the franchise. Black Widow and Hawkeye's mission to retrieve the Soul Stone is a poignant highlight, showcasing the deep bond between the two characters and culminating in a heartbreaking sacrifice.The final act of ""Endgame"" is nothing short of spectacular. The climactic battle against Thanos is a visual and emotional tour de force, featuring the largest assembly of superheroes ever seen on screen. The return of the dusted heroes through Doctor Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch) portals is a triumphant moment that ignites the audience's excitement. Every character gets their moment to shine, and the action choreography is both exhilarating and coherent, avoiding the pitfalls of chaotic editing that plague many blockbuster finales.Yet, it is the smaller, quieter moments that truly elevate ""Endgame."" Tony Stark's reconciliation with his father during the time heist, Thor's emotional encounter with his mother, and Steve Rogers' decision to finally live a life for himself are all scenes that resonate deeply, providing a satisfying emotional payoff. The film's conclusion, which sees Captain America passing his shield to Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Iron Man's ultimate sacrifice to save the universe, are powerful, defining moments that underscore the themes of legacy and heroism.""Avengers: Endgame"" is not without its flaws. The time travel mechanics, while fun, can be convoluted and require a suspension of disbelief. Some fans may also feel that certain characters, like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), were underutilized given the build-up to their introductions. However, these are minor quibbles in the context of the film's overarching success.In conclusion, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a cinematic triumph that honors the past, embraces the present, and sets the stage for the future. It is a fitting conclusion to the Infinity Saga, blending action, emotion, and character development in a way that few films of its scale can achieve. For fans of the MCU, it is an unforgettable experience and a testament to what can be achieved when storytelling, character, and spectacle are perfectly balanced."
2209,"May 17, 2019",10,"So i've already watched this film at cinema. yeah actully in first day , but the tickets sold out and i came in second day . soo i was cry .not cry bad ,but in my heart this film is touching u know , u knew bout the war ,and things , and this is the end of avengers . thank u :)"
2210,"Apr 29, 2019",7,"Just saw so called and talked this movie. It is just hype and to say truly it is a movie that marks below previous Marvel movies. Because after seeing this movie your mind will be empty and you will be not satisfied with whole drama feeling that something was missing, yes thrill of superheroes is totally missing here. Reasons are following as me, others may have their own different opinion than me, but me, watch the movie only for full of entertainment with not much expectation. High rated tickets should give you full value of your money and three hours of life. High ratings are false and all are copying to support only for this average movie. Reasons are many; 1. The starting of last chapter is very slow and dull, whereas it needs some powerful actions or at least interesting incidents to keep viewers connect early to the story. 2. Hawkeye lost his family, how? And why not he lost himself ?. ( Thanos spares him?) 3. Planning to time robbery with quantum theory is very slow and time consuming only. 4. It takes too long time to start the real drama cum fight. 5. Time robbery is so confused. It is not cleared that how lost heros came return in life. What is that method was been applied not shown anywhere. 6. If Thanos is vanished by Iron man then how he will regain again to finish some superheros as shown in Infinity War ? Is there any paradox theories? Not cleared by director. Various time lines are so confused7. In this such a big saga of returning our lost heros into life, what is the role of Nick Fury as he only show his face at final scene. As me he must have a major role for planning the time plan. 8. There is only a single fight, first and last with not impressive only lengthy and boring. 9. Such super movie must have solid logic plot and here Infinity War was better. 10. Nothing new plot. I actually wait till end to happen something different. 11. Captain Marvel has no significant role here even her character was created with a single separate movie to enter in Endgame? 12. Thor is shown drunkard with tummy belly. It is not acceptable as our hero is our role model. I actually feel shame to see such nonsense thing.A very few things are good like CGI work, father of Iron Man, Natasha's sacrifice etc for name. Hulk's anger on footing stairs is just hilarious comical sequence. I really enjoyed it.Acting is okay and no one expect good acting in such comics movies.As me the movie is watchable but not for much entertainer. It is only deserve 7 star. And lovers of Iron Man and Natasha, don't be disappointed they will meet you in future because it is comics universe."
2211,"Apr 28, 2019",1,It was everything for me. The way they linked all the ends was marvelous. I found all the happiness and sadness at the same time. Love you Iron man 3000. And now we all do know who's Captain. And sadest thing was to lose widow. And I still love Red witch She was incredible. At the end Thank You Marvel.
2212,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Avengers: Endgame is hands down one of the best or probably the best movie of the year. Even though it's basically a part two of Avengers: Infinity War, it seems like a completely different movie right from the start. The movie has some amazing performances from the likes of Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans and many more. I hope to see Endgame winning awards at next years Oscars. This film was the best possible way to wrap up such an amazing franchise. Thank you Marvel."
2213,"Apr 27, 2019",10,This is a must see film!! It's EASILY the best avenger movie of all time. It's 3 hours long but i didn't look at my watch once. Movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.
2214,"May 18, 2019",10,"I REALLY loved watching this epic conclusion to one of the most respected franchises of all time. With 'Endgame', this movie has exceeded all expectations for all Marvel fans out there. The Russos, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, and Kevin Feige had a lot of fun assembling this billion-dollar-worthy masterpiece. It can get emotional at times, but it is worth all the fun. 'Endgame' has achieved the top rank that outshines every other MCU movie ever existed. The heroes can think, act, and react because of their challenges they had to go through.For Marvel - keep up the good work."
2215,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"I think this was a good movie, but it felt like I had just left a funeral when heading home from the theatre."
2216,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"As the most anticipated film of the year, Endgame certainly doesn't have it easy, but you won't be disappointed."
2217,"May 3, 2019",9,"Does this movie have loopholes, of course it does - nothing is perfect but you tend to ignore them and focus on the pure joy and excitement you get from watching this movie. So many emotions and how they connected their very first movie to the last (no spoilers) - it was sheer brilliance.A job very very well done. Didn't disappoint."
2218,"Jul 2, 2020",10,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of the MCU and this film absolutely delivered with emotion, visuals, action and comedy. The film may be long but it's certainly never boring. Check out this film because it is great!"
2219,"Apr 29, 2019",6,"What a movie! Only one fight, and best end fight 👌👍👏"
2220,"Jul 25, 2022",10,"The best of the best, when you think of how a superhero movie needs to be done think of Avengers: Endgame. The epic blockbuster that gave fans all the payoff they deserved after 22 movies and 10 years Robert Downey Jr does a stand out job as his final performance as Iron Man he puts so much heart into his character in this movie, the intensity and well pacing makes this movie super watchable it doesn't feel like three hours and that is a good thing. Marvel knew what they were doing when they made this masterpiece."
2221,"May 3, 2019",9,"The most complete hero movie I ever seen. Full of emotions and loves. Make hero seem vulnerable and as human as us. And yet make the sacrifice as the last resort Good job marvel , the thing is we will be expecting a higher ceiling next time and I think it's difficult to raise. A really emotional journey for me has ended."

2225,"Apr 27, 2019",1,"The only reason I have this terrible movie a 1, is because I can't give it a zero. I don't know what I was thinking watching this, but it was awful, just a waste."
2226,"Dec 28, 2023",8,"Caught ""Avengers: Endgame"" and, whoa, it's a cinematic masterpiece!No spoilers, promise. The movie is a rollercoaster of emotions, action, and nostalgia. It's like a love letter to every Marvel fan out there. The stakes are high, and the payoff is even higher.The character arcs? Brilliantly done. You see sides of these superheroes you've never thought of. The humour is on point, and the camaraderie is heartwarming. And that soundtrack - epic!Without giving anything away, the final battle is mind-blowing. The Russo brothers nailed it. You'll be on the edge of your seat, I guarantee.""Avengers: Endgame"" isn't just a movie; it's an experience. A fitting end to an era. If you've been following the Marvel saga, this one's the grand finale you've been waiting for.Go watch it, like now."
2227,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Spoiler free review! I cried, I laughed, I cried and I laughed again and this is what we all did throughout the movie. The direction of MCU and particularly for this movie is unbelievable. All characters, as well as the story, are giving a perfect end to the Saga. MUST MUST MUST WATCH! You won't be able to control your emotions.❤"
2228,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Pure emotions went through while watching this movie. I cried I laughed, I cried again and then I laughed and this was the perfect end to a Saga of superheroes who made our childhood awesome! Thanks to Russo Brothers for this awesome and unbelievable direction, Avengers Cast for bringing their best at the right time and of course not to forget STAN LEE❤"
2229,"May 3, 2019",10,Best comic book movie ever .......................................... .
2230,"Apr 29, 2019",6,"A fairly entertaining hero movie that, even with its long running time, doesn't really feel tiring. It begins interestingly and in pure Avengers style it becomes more and more chaotic as time progresses. This is a consequence of the too many storylines that need to be merged and the too many characters that are to be followed. Tonal shifts are omnipresent and a few characters are thrown out of context for the sake of unnecessary comic relief. With the story progressing, typical cliches of ending stories become apparent and unexplained convenient turn of events start to happen. This is nothing new and, as in the previous movies, sometimes it's just impossible to make sense of how and why a situation occurs. You have to accept it for the sake of the storyline be it someone suddenly becoming overpowered, acquiring a new power or conveniently stumbling upon a revelation. In the end, an unimpressive and quite predictable storyline spiced with great effects, a good soundtrack and a few interesting characters."
2231,"Apr 30, 2019",3,"What the.... did Disney do? I know the wannabe cinema fan will be like ""that was a well deserved ending""... Like how? The story does not add up.. Really does not make sense... The solution to try save everyone is like xmen day of the future past concept ""reset button""The actors really Marvell this shows that Disney is loosing it with there political agenda? All the scenes she was in felt like a reshoot.. Like they had no plans for Marvell and it was forced! Thor... What a.... shameWhere are the times that you could actually expect spectacular scene action worthy moment.... Instead of a.... comedy show full of meme!!!We are not a generation who are brain dead yet!! I wiil stick to the comics and leave the cinema to the real fans!"
2232,"Apr 25, 2019",10,Fantastic story..my mind blowed out..Admirable movie and character and also story..
2233,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Endgame was a great way to end an amazing 11 years. I loved every second of it. Usually I'll disagree with some moments, but in this one, I loved every single second."
2234,"May 26, 2019",7,Boring long and expected Infinity war was more excited
2235,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Can't stop crying. Epic ride with A6. Eleven years. Perfect ending for them.
2236,"Apr 27, 2019",7,"To start off, I am not a mcu fan and this review is completely non biased. First of all, the movie is not bad, nor great in my opinion..it's just an overall good film. The first half of the movie for me was very slow and laggy, however it picks up its pace later on. I haven't watched every marvel movie so I didn't really understand a lot of the references that were made so that was another downside for me. The way they handled Thor kind of disappointed me bcuz he is my fav avenger but it's ok bcuz he was kinda funny. The ending is the best part of the movie because the action, goosebump moments, and emotional scenes were done very well. Overall, I think they could have trimmed a lot of the first half of the movie bcuz 3 hours felt very long when there are a lot of scenes that didn't contribute much to the plot. However, I think mcu fans will definetily enjoy the movie much much more than a neutral like me. It's a good movie, trust me, but not the best. Give it a watch bcuz it won't disappoint you, that's for sure!"
2237,"Apr 26, 2019",2,"The avengers: End game movie is the worst out of all the marvel movies. With an horrible end and a bad plot. For a normal, sane person this is a too wacky movie with a lot of weird twists. The only really good thing in this movie is the avengers theme song that gives the movie a little spark in the total darkness that it is in. If you consider watching this movie DON'T."
2238,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Unbelievable. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many.I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies. I will watch it again and again and again. Love it more than 3000.It leaves you at the edge of your seat and the 3rd act is just insane and a masterpiece. Infinity War was fantastic but this is insanity, in all the right ways. The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some.Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this. It's an experience that You'll remember forever.There are times when people were clapping, laughing & crying at the same time. There's also one scene where whole theatre was kept silent because they are so much engaged with the movie. You know that it's a superhero movie and in the end superheroes will win but, how they portray the whole story left everyone in the hall speechless.It's Conclusion to a long running Saga & Yes End of an ERA!"
2239,"Apr 26, 2019",10,This has to be one of the greatest movies of all time. The full story leading up to this is spectacular.
2240,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"And not in a good way.This movie is one of the most ambitious movies to ever be made, that alone makes it a cinematic moment to be remembered, however this whole movie is eerily predictable. As you venture through the 3 hour flick, you are met with predictable plot points, very shallow and faux humor that tries to break tension, and a very lacking character growth from point A to point B. Sure, if you were to watch ALL of the 22 movies of the MCU you'd see the arch, but in this movie, especially in the main characters, we don't see a change during its run. Characters make decisions that dont really fit their personality and overall it just leaves the 3 hour venture shallow and dry. It is 2 and half hours of filler with really just two scenes of significance.That being said, the visuals are great, the score is better than most Marvel movies and this is a great wrap to a disappointing Phase 3 of the MCU series"
2241,"Nov 8, 2019",10,"It is an amazing movie but I think there had to be a little more action because it felt like one big mission for 2hr 30mins but last 30mins was the action part,I feel like it should be 2hrs storyline and 1hr action since the movie should be based on action because it's a superhero movie."
2242,"Aug 2, 2019",3,"Captain America, Iron man and the Avengers all should have stopped after their first movie. Antman was terrible whatsoever and only Thor Ragnarok was a better movie than the first in the serie. Endgame is a horrible movie and only rated high since it is the end of a well appreciated line."
2243,"May 3, 2019",9,An amazing movie. I couldn't imagine how hard it is to live up to and end a franchise like this. They managed to make an amazing movie. Coming from a comic book lover. I don't think anyone could have done it better.
2244,"Aug 23, 2024",9,"Avengers Endgame is the epic conclusion to the Infinity Saga in the MCU. It is understandable why it had grossed so much with it taking off after the cliffhanger ending Infinity War and calls back to earlier MCU movies through time travel and brings an ending to a couple characters. Despite being called Endgame, it does leave room for some characters' stories to continue in phase 4 and the current phase 5. It is more talky than Infinity War and focused more on the character arcs than the action. That helps with the character development that really happened in it I did find it is one of the more watchable longer films. Sometimes longer movies seen like they go on for too long but Endgame doesn't feel like it is too long.I feel like I like Infinity War a bit better with it having more action alongside the emotional story."
2245,"Nov 24, 2019",10,"This is the best movie ever made. If it isn't for the haters due to the success of this movie, it probably gonna be the top 3 on imdb"
2246,"May 6, 2019",7,Just watch it. LOADS OF FUN. Not any kind of masterpiece though. Doesn't come close to the best film of 2019 so far (Us)
2247,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Epic, and utterly satisfying conclusion to everything that came before it!"
2248,"Jul 31, 2019",6,"The cgi effects are horrible, has parts where it looks like Shrek.. the move is way too long, to many useless scenes, just boring. I barely made it in 3 attempts"
2249,"May 20, 2019",1,"Overated, boring nonsense! Infinity war set me up for what I thought was going to be the best marvel movie ever but end game felt like it was trying too hard to please everyone! Instead of just being a really good marvel movie. The plot holes were a big part of the disappointment for me."
2250,"Mar 17, 2020",10,"It would an understatement to call this motion picture ""an adequate film"". It is quite the amazing film. The plot really is a home run, and the ending battle with the titan Thanos is amazing. The ending was sad(no spoilers). Definitely reserve time, your favorite snack foods, and days to watch this incredible film."
2251,"May 31, 2019",9,First film to make me cry since home alone 4 on VHS in 2011
2252,"Apr 27, 2019",9,A great ending for this particular marvel storyline and cast of great actors. This movie contains ell the elements we have come to love since the first Ironman. But this time on overdrive.
2253,"Feb 14, 2022",8,I would have to say this movie ended really well. I was very pleased on what they did with the original avengers from the first movie. And with all the characters they brought together it added some intense and amazing action sequences. But overall i was very satisfied with it.
2254,"Apr 26, 2019",6,Just got back from the midnight showing and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I get that its the final avengers movie but they spent two hours paying homage to previous films and characters and retread a lot of the original plot. In doing so they effectively dulled Thanos's presence and much of the enjoyment of the movie. I hate to say it but Captain Marvel seemed like a useless addition as she really didn't bring much to the table and her presence ruins Thanos's threat. Anyway the production values were great and it was nice to see all the characters make an appearance in some form but it wasn't bet foot to go out on.
2255,"Apr 27, 2019",3,Majorly disappointed. It didn't have as much character development as I would've hoped for M' Baku.
2256,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Its finally here. The moment we've all been waiting for. Avengers Endgame is now in cinemas and you should go watch it right now. I don't know how many times I plan on watching it but it is worth every penny no matter how many times you plan on watching it because it's that good. Forget good, it's great. Forget great, its spectacular.Avengers Endgame takes place immediately after last year's heart-stopping Infinity War cliffhanger where our surviving heroes are in grief of what happened and the rest for you to watch. This is by far the best Marvel movie ever made. Endgame is the conclusion of a journey we've all been going throughout 22 movies. It is a worthy end to the original six Avengers arcs, leaving space for our new superheroes to take their place and lead a whole new generation of Marvel-lous storytelling. But let's not talk about the future, we are focusing on Endgame here.Unlike Infinity War, the stakes are higher, the drama is wells up in you constantly and the sheer epicness of what makes this Avengers installment so perfect is that from beginning to end, you will laugh, cry or have goosebumps all over your body. The highlight of the movie was, of course, our beloved six original Avengers, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Making them the main focus once again after so long was a step at the right direction and it would totally make sense since we all know that Endgame will be their last movie together. The best among them all was Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. Finally seeing them together after havoc that was Civil War and working together, trusting each other again was an absolute treat for all us fans.I can't tell you anything about the storyline for that I would be spoiling you but I can tell you the 3 hour runtime was worth it. Come to think of it, it didn't feel like I was watching it for 3 hours for that I wasn't bored or looking at the time. No scene felt pointless or draggy. The entire 3 hours keeps you attentive, at the edge of your seat and makes sure your eyes do not get to miss a single second. The pace seemed familiar to all famous fantasy epics such as Lord of The Rings and Game of Thrones. Like LOTR and GOT, they focused more on character development and getting the audience to experience what the characters going through as well. With that, there are the epic battle scenes and the epic score to go with it. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely outdid themselves making their most complicated and best Marvel script ever. Alan Silvestri returned to write the score once again and outdid himself by including themes from all the previous movies including his previous scores from Captain America The First Avenger and the main Avengers theme by making it them sound more brassier and bigger, fitting the to the scope and tone of Endgame.So, Endgame. Go watch it. Marvel fan or not, do not miss the epic finale to the Infinity Saga of the MCU. If you do end up missing it, you should live under rock or kill yourself with a rock. With that I'm rating Avengers Endgame 12/10 because it exceeded all my expectations of a great Marvel movie. I thought Infinity War was spectacular but Endgame, there is still no words I can find to explain what the movie or how it made me feel, not only as a Marvel but as a moviegoer which makes Endgame even more of a superhero spectacle than Infinity War.P.S. unfortunately, there is no post credit scenes or end credit scenes"
2257,"May 1, 2019",9,"I know I gave it a 9/10 but there's a reason for that there are 2 epic scenes in this film that deserve the 9/10 rating, but the movie overall was 7/10 maybe a little lower 6.9/10, I just expected more, this morning or started great and surprising, but then the middle was lost and messy to say the least the ending was epic though,"
2258,"Apr 25, 2019",10,What a way to end 10 years of marvel! Prepare yourself.
2259,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"With hopes and expectations reaching sky-high, the Russo-brothers directed movie doesn't let you down at any point of this mega-delight. Has a lot of moments for whistles and cheers, and also the ones to make you emotional. Goosebumps throughout the movie. Perfectly set in what could be confusing timelines(but the Russos managed it quite handsomely). Visual treat, actors were in their A-game, drama set on the highest of notes, larger than life visuals, background scores keep you totally invested, and the tried and tested formula of superhero humour is an icing on cake. Package of nostalgia and a step into phase 4 with goodbye to few of our favourite characters makes this one of best superhero movies made till date. After 11 years 21 movies, MARVEL STUDIOS still pulls of an extraordinary flick."
2260,"Jun 26, 2021",6,"I am not a huge Marvel fan. I have watched some if the Avenger movies but not all.Basically, all I remember from it is that it was full of CGI explosions and scenes created via the same.What happened to actors acting? This entire movie was special effects with a few giggles.Three hours Wasted."
2261,"Apr 27, 2019",9,"Avengers end game was like a thanks giving turkey, the movie statisfy all of the movie fans like what kind of thing will people see and enjoy those elements were present in this movie in a tremendous manner.I like most is this has lots of other things than the fight sequence, when putting all the super heroes one place most probably there will always we lots of fights sequences but in this movie we have everything that's the special"
2262,"Apr 24, 2019",7,First half is boring AF and movie is so overhyped.
2263,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"The first two-thirds of the movie is very inventive. Swinging from bleak to It plays around with the narrative and the concept of time in this story. This slow burn, full of trademark MCU humor, is unpredictable and welcome."
2264,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This movie was perfection and made it worth the wait, it's a must see!"
2265,"Apr 24, 2019",6,Not enough action Not enough Spider-ManWell not enough word for making a review
2266,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"The Russo brother did it! They gave a majestic conclusion to a tuli marvelous saga. I have never cried so many times in a movie and my body gave me a new ""feeling"": at one very cool moment of the movie my body just... shook. I was amazed of how much they could cover in ""just"" 3 hours and it surely didn't feel that long. Things I wanted to happen, happened better I hoped. I am just very happy for this movie, it is now my favorite movie of all time and I can't wait to see it again!"
2267,"Apr 26, 2019",7,I won't spoil the movie but here's what it is in short.It's not extremely action packed but it does have an amazing fight. It's logic is inconsistent at times and it's kind of irritating. Don't inflate your expectations for this film because you won't walk away satisfied.
2268,"Apr 29, 2019",1,"Failure with no purpose , and the rating is all about fans"
2269,"Jan 19, 2022",10,"Avengers Finale is the highest-grossing film in history, which overtook all films, and at the same time quite successful film that many fans of the Marvel movie universe were waiting for.The film itself is a continuation of the previous film - Avengers Infinity War, which ended with the defeat of the main characters. In the same movie, we see the consequences of this defeat, as the whole planet survives it, including the main characters.The performance of all the actors is excellent, everyone both played well and plays. They conveyed their characters very well, which is now rare.The graphics in the movie are amazing, the special effects are at a great level, in general, nothing bad can be said about these moments.To sum up, in conclusion, I want everyone who has not watched to advise this film to watch, it's worth it."
2270,"Apr 24, 2019",10,"I'm as happy as I can get having watched this masterpiece of a superhero movie! Even though it's sad and heart-breaking at some points, the overall feeling it leaves you with is pure awe and wanting for more. The sadness is well-deserved for some beloved characters but it's all done logically and in a noble way.The audience and I laughed a good deal throughout the movie (just like it was with Ragnarok), and 3 hours passed in an instant, I didn't get bored and didn't feel tired at the end. However I am speechless at the grandeur and scale of this finale.I have nothing else to say here (or have I?) except for: I envy all of you who is yet to enjoy all the twists and turns of this beautiful movie for the very first time!:)What are you still waiting for?! Go watch it! Now!"
2271,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"11 years ago when iron man came out who would of thought we would of been here? 20 films later and were in the endgame. Simply incredible, from beginning to end, a feat of cinema. The humour, the emotion, the nostalgia and the satisfaction the movie brings is truly special. There is no other film like it, Stan lee would be proud-heres to another 10 years, excelsior :)"
2272,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"It was good but IW was better. Reminds me of Kill Bill Vol 1, remember how good Volume 1 was, then they released Kill Bill volume 2 and it was anti-climactic and weak compared to the superior first movie. It does have some great scenes but they were few and far between. Movie had too much filler."
2273,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"I really like every single part of the movie, at any time i was watching the movie i was in shock every second in that movie is to die for, really a masterpiece"
2274,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Best movie ever to watch, Very emotional, powerful, satisfying"
2275,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"Endgame is a good movie. There is a lot of quality. But after all the hype and the excellent ""Infinity War"" I probably expected too much.What I liked: The actors did a great job, esp. Robert Downey Junior. The screentime of Captain Marvel was reduced to a tolerable minimum. Our original heroes all get their moments to shine. Humor was hit and miss but mostly it worked. The ""Thor is a slob now"" joke was a bit overused though. The end battle is pretty epic.What I disliked: There was not enough action and the story drags at times. The Time Travel idea was probably the only way out of the corner the writers had written themselves in after Infinity War and there are also the typical problems/plotholes that come with time travel stories.It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its good conclusion."
2276,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"The story was well written, seeded with humorous as well as tearful scenes. It tied together the multiple stories of it's legendary characters with decent closure. Were there plot holes, yes, but this is sci/fi fantasy. am I going to spoil it... no, I encourage you to watch it. Positive note, no hidden agendas or political propaganda to sour the material regardless of characters portrayed... no animals mistreated in the filming thereof...#hailhydra #Icoulddothisallday"
2277,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"After all the hype I was convinced it couldn't top the last one. I was wrong. Aside from personally not liking the direction they went with one character, I have literally 0 complaints. It's wonderful. Go see it."
2278,"Jul 19, 2020",6,"I didn't hate this the same as the Transformer franchise, or reboot of Star wars. Unfortunately they all are cookie cutter films, look, taste, feel the same, nothing really sets it apart. My 2 biggest issues with this film were did it really need to be 2 3/4 hrs long. I figure with a good film editor they could have clipped 25 min and not ruin the pacing, the second is Bree Larson. I just find her unlikable. Downey, Hemsworth great as always. Would love to see Hemsworth, take on the 007 role once Craig retires. Last cameo for Stan Lee.Endgame isn't a bad film, just nothing really special about it either. I can find more fulfilling ways to spend 2 3/4 hrs."
2279,"Apr 24, 2019",6,Went in with very high expectation because of IW (I watched IW 3 times) and the inclusion of Capt Marvel (didn't like the movie thou). It got some good moments (milking the sadness of defeat) and some clever and inspirational lines (which I think is very important for superhero movies that mcu a bit lacking). Sometimes the jokes came in the way of the emotional moments thou. Felt a bit uneven overall. Hope for so much more from Capt Marvel but ... And bit sad looking at Hulk and Thor become victim of plot. It's quite a mixed feeling movie for me. Just an ok I guess?
2280,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"What began back in 2008 with Iron Man has grown in to this fully matured universe with excitement, awe, thrills and sadness, and finally it must come to its endgame. (Pun intended)From the start of the movie you're immediately reminded of the ending of Infinity War, thrust in to the affects of Thanos' snap, from this moment on the emotional ride begins. The movie manages to perfectly balance the action, plot moments, character arcs and character conclusions, and paces you along the way. From the get-go, you think you have this all figured out, what's going to happen but most of you will be wrong.The Russo brothers manages to bring this heavily invested universe to a close in what could be considered the greatest Marvel film to date with the largest ever assembled cast. I cannot recommend you see this just once however, the 3 hour run-time that this movies demands is warranted and satisfying but make sure you go to the toilet just before you watch it.And just to save you the time; this movie (fittingly) has NO after credits or mid credits scene.Enjoy!"
2281,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"So I've never written a review before but thought this deserved it. Before watching this I found myself wondering how this movie would play out, how it would all work. Let me tell you, it all worked and in a way I never imagined it would. The story was just so perfect. It had everything, from laughter to sadness and pure awe inspiring satisfaction. The ending was probably perfect. I was literally sitting in my seat with my mouth open from amazement from what I was watching. I truly believe this movie deserves an Oscar for best picture."
2282,"Apr 19, 2020",10,"This is by far one of the greatest cinematic events in history. This film was just a pure masterpiece. To be honest, the beginning was pretty slow, but after an hour and a half, the movie got epic. What a way to conclude the story of marvel's most beloved heroes."
2283,"Jul 5, 2019",6,"How are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in ""Infinity War"" weren't just a dream): magic or time travel. All I'll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of ""Back to the Future II"" (1989).""Endgame"" (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.Everything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff's edge, and much more.Unfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can't concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie's overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute.GRADE: B-"
2284,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"A culmination of 11 years of characters in one movie is hard to pull of yet pull it off well, combining incredible heart felt moments along with a surprising amount of funny ones too for a movie suffering from the dreadful consequences of the last, well worth the watch if at all a fan of marvel"
2285,"Apr 27, 2019",6,"To begin with, it was a good film, decent acting, great effects, a lot of funny parts where whole cinema laughts, but to get a 9/10 or even higher rating movie must have much much better than that, so probably only comics fan boys can rate it higher. The truth is that movie was too long, last hour or at least half hour of the movie was a waste of time, its sci fi, not documentary movie, we dont need to see how they live happy ever after, also despite good fulfillment, you have to say that scenario is what, time machine scenario is the easiest one to extract more money, but the movie leaves the feeling that it is not the true ending. Also the biggest lie is that someone wants to watch it second or third time, even when watching the first one, last hour you question yourself when it will finnish."
2286,"Jun 20, 2019",2,"I have watched the movie when it was just released. A couple of months later and I was looking at the reviews. I cannot believe all the 10/10 scores for this movie.Personally I was extremely disappointed with this final movie. Infinity war was an amazing good movie, end game delivers a very simple story based on the time machine concept with plenty of flaws. While I understand the hype and the popularity of the MCU the movie was not bringing me what I was hoping for. There is no further clarification of what led to this movie. The new hulk is another example what I believe was too far fetched. But I don't think I should continue. Surely it is a must see, but for me remains Endgame one of the less convincing movie of this long series of movies brought to us in the las ten years."
2287,"May 6, 2019",8,"Hulk's glasses appear and reappear routinely from shot to shot without any shots of him putting them on or taking them off. In any event, with so many magical superpowers floating about ... one would think that Bruce Banner shouldn't have myopia or need to go to the opticians (on a buy one get one free basis) to get two sizes of glasses."
2288,"Apr 26, 2019",8,"Avengers Endgame from a technical standpoint is a downgrade from the previous Infinity War. But what it lacks in technicality and overall quality it more or less make it up with emotions, stakes and an abundance of fanservice.The pacing is fairly inconsistent, storytelling botched and action sequences minimal. Rather the Russo brothers put emphasis on character development over plot, which were basically more or less presented in the last movie. And the characters were mostly handled pretty well except for one character, which I wont spoil.Endgame is less of a movie, more of a love letter to the fans that stayed with the MCU ever since Tony Stark built a suit in a cave. It's the Russo brothers way of letting you know that they heard us and they want to satisfy what we want to see, and they did just that and even more.I do have few gripes with few parts of the movie but the pay off in the end is insurmountable. A near perfect, nay perfect conclusion to the Infinity Gauntlet storyline which will have you come back here time after time only to watch the third act one more time. Movies hardly pay off as good as this."
2289,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"Funny, emotional and immensely satisfying! Great way to draw so many stories to a close. Whether you're a massive marvel fan or a casual movie goer, check this movie out in the big screen and enjoy the awesome experience!"
2290,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"It made laugh it made me cry it made excited. This movie is a true love letter to the fans.They promised and they delivered. This is 11 years in the making, and i have to say it worth the wait ! GO WATCH IT ! ITS EPIC!!"
2291,"Apr 27, 2019",10,A fantastic climax to the MCU. Hard to post a review without spoilers my
2292,"May 4, 2019",9,"Spoiler free review here.If you are invested at all in any of the Marvel characters, than this is a must see. It was a perfect conclusion to the first three phases of the MCU and it makes us wonder where they can go next that'll feel new and fresh. Worth watching, ignore the haters and negative reviews. Sure there are plot holes but we're talking about a universe in which a guy created his own element and an entire country uses a metal as basically magic and says its technology. Every Marvel movie has plot holes, this one is no exception."
2293,"Apr 26, 2019",7,Some beautiful character moments that cut through right to the character's core and a fantastic ode to the past ten years. Just would have liked some nuanced action.
2294,"Jun 7, 2019",1,I watch probably 1 movie on an average every week from last 3 years and have watched a lot of boring movies but this is the first time I could not watch a movie to the end Can't be more boring movie then this
2295,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"After 11 years and with 22 films being released in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Endgame reaches a satisfying and emotionally gut-wrenching conclusion that delivers a larger spectrum of heartbreaking, superb, and thrilling stakes and twists, combined with every powerful performances within the entire ensemble cast, a wide-ranging display of emotions and depth, a masterstroke screenplay, storytelling and direction, a suspenseful and thrilling musical score, and a coherent and nuanced visual effects, sound design, pacing and editing. Avengers Endgame ultimately serves as the shining pinnacle and an outstanding finale tribute to the Infinity Saga within the Marvel Cinematic Universe that all started with 2008's Iron Man.While Black Panther remains as the unique, phenomenal, and inspirational masterpiece of the MCU and a cultural significance; Avengers: Endgame is something more of just being a masterpiece but a phenomenal legacy and a magnum opus, not just within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but throughout the entire cinema, of all which it ties with other classical cinematic masterpieces with great endings such as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2.Without any doubt, Avengers: Endgame truly serves as the greatest superhero movie alongside Black Panther, Logan, and The Dark Knight, as well as the greatest movie that will forever defined pop culture and modern cinema in years and decades to come."
2296,"Jun 10, 2019",8,Overall Endgame was a solid movie. The first hour of the film may seem a little sluggish but the action and story telling makes up for it. The ending and fight scenes were amazing. Overall good film u recommend watching a couple times in theater and adding to your home video collection.
2297,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"Before you start tearing your eyes out because you think this film was a masterpiece, I can assure you that it most certainly was not. Was it fun to watch? Absolutely. It was fun and funny but the film is riddled with plot holes and attempts to alter its entire arc to accommodate a wider universe that apparently relies on Captain Marvel which makes no sense. The film felt very lazy when it came to the interweaving of ten years of previous films and ultimately falls flat on its face. Perhaps the films after this will fix the mistakes but calling it the end of the infinity saga leads us to believe it is the beginning of an entirely new timeline saga since the timeline we knew is now long gone. Yes, despite cap returning the stones, the timeline we originally loved is now the past and this new five year ahead timeline is the world they want us to live in. No thanks. You'll need to earn my trust back."
2298,"Jun 26, 2024",10,"After 11 years and 22 films, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) reaches a turning point with ""Avengers: Endgame"". This epic finale not only concludes the story set in motion by ""Avengers: Infinity War"" but also wraps up character arcs that began years ago.The film's structure is surprising: the first hour focuses less on action and more on character development. The original Avengers-Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk, and Hawkeye-take center stage. Their decisions and actions resonate with their entire journey, making this a deeply emotional experience.Ant-Man and Nebula also play crucial roles, while Thanos remains menacing. Although a few flaws exist, including rushed sequences, the overall impact is sumptuous and exhilarating. The craft, world-building, and devotion to character empathy shine through.In summary, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a brilliant MCU finale-a must-see for fans and a testament to the franchise's enduring magic."
2299,"Jul 15, 2019",1,"This was probably one of the worst movie I have seen, even on the Marvel scale. How can they take so many talented actors and make this non-sense? I laughed every time emotional drama came. Instead of tears, I was was feeling pity for myself. I hope this is really the endgame. But I doubt."
2300,"May 16, 2020",8,"It's hard to admit that there will be a superhero movie among the top 10 in 2019. Tragic, epic, affectionate, these words, which did not exist in Marvel's dictionary, can be shown in this final chapter. For passers-by, this is a business masterpiece with self consistent logic, orderly rhythm and proper arrangement. For fans, this is a youth farewell ceremony with supreme feelings."
2301,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"This movie lives up to the hype, fantastic directing and story telling.This movie lifts some of the most iconic moments in the Marvel Universe straight from the comic page.Roll on the next 11 years of Marvel Magic!"
2302,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"This movie has everything that fans wanted in MCU, a pure tribute to the previous stories and most satisfying completion of the saga. It is funny, emotional, thrilling, action packed roller-coaster ride. Three hours run-time never felt long, it went by very quickly. I could have happily watched even longer version (I demand a longer version ;) ). The Original six truly shines in this one and great characterization. Stark is just awesome as always, as does Rogers, Thor, Banner, Barton and Romanoff. They started this adventure beautifully and ended this with a bang. Since this is a spoiler free review I won't delve into the conclusion of their individual character arcs but Cap's is although satisfying but still bothering me. There maybe many things which will make more sense or less after more viewing but for now that's all.""Part of the journey is the end"""
2303,"Jun 30, 2019",10,"This is what we were waiting for after the devastating loss for the avengers in infinity war, this movie has a lot of heartbreaking, Jaw dropping, funny, heartfelt and epic moments than any other superhero movie. This is worth your money"
2304,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Masterpiece, end of an era. Great movie. The best marvel-movie ever made."
2305,"Apr 27, 2019",6,The movie was ok. I seen it yesterday. First 2.5 hrs is no action or fighting at all. The last 30 mins was a big fight. Captain marvel showed up in beginning of movie and the end. I def couldn't watch it again for 3 hrs
2306,"Apr 29, 2019",6,"Like much of other series , avengers gets worse with the end. Honestly, to my opinion not worth to go to cinema. Infinity wars was much better. I was expecting a great ending, not this."
2307,"May 7, 2019",1,Worst film of all time in the whole film industry.the most over hyped film ever in the world.absolutely disastrous and useless movie.
2308,"Nov 28, 2019",10,"As a Marvel fan, all I can say is that I am very much thrilled, and satisfied with how the Endgame turned out. The CGI was great, the story on point, and it brought back to life all the superheroes that I love."
2309,"Apr 26, 2019",9,Kinda feels rushed through the beginning kinda wish the end was cut into one more movie because there is so much they could have done. But im pleased regardless
2310,"Oct 12, 2019",9,"Thanks Marvel and Disney, for all these years. Can't wait to see the phase 4."
2311,"Mar 21, 2020",10,Awsome Movie Great ending.i was surprised when all the avengers were gathered in one place.But it has a emotional ending.I Love You 3000 IRONMAN !
2312,"Apr 30, 2019",10,Its an awsome movie...every over should watch it who likes sci fie movies..
2313,"May 10, 2019",10,"I have watch endgame 5 times, thanks to A-list. I really enjoy every detail of this movie. To be honest, entire marvel movies more like tv show to me, and this is the season finally, to be accurate far from home is the end of phase 3 but you know what I mean. Don't recommend newbie to watch btw, you will 100% got lost"
2314,"Apr 27, 2019",9,"A movie that celebrates the lat 11 years of Marvel Movies, focusing on the first avengers and making you feel happy, sad and nostalgic in 3 hours long."
2315,"Apr 29, 2019",6,Out of all 3 hours of film there was an only 20 mins of pure entertainment
2316,"Apr 25, 2019",10,This movie was absolutely perfect. There is nothing more I wanted in this film and it gave me all kinds of emotions that I've never felt in a movie Before! it had the most satisfying ending and it really did conclude the Avengers. The final battle is way more that I could've ever wanted and they also made Hawkeye so badass and I loved him in this film 😂
2317,"Mar 18, 2020",9,"I'm a big fan of Marvel movies. I watched it twice in the cinema. The details of the movie are very good, which reminded me of the previous Marvel movies."
2318,"Apr 28, 2019",10,The amazing end of the journey.... From beginning to end the plot was really really good.. loved it
2319,"Jul 23, 2019",10,"Awesome thriller and drama,with comedy,sadness. I watch it three times and will buy on blue ray disc. I can't wait for more story continues on phrase 4."
2320,"May 6, 2019",9,This movie did everything great. There were some brilliant moments where I got Return Of The King vibes and I was pumped out of my mind. They really surprised me with how they chose to play this one out and all I can say is the Russos pulled it off amazingly. Also the soundtrack was incredible with a spectacular final act.
2321,"May 12, 2022",10,"If you like fantasy, adventure, and superheroes, I suggest you watch ""Avengers: Endgame"". ""Avengers: Endgame"" - is an American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics. Released on April 26, 2019. Directed by Anthony Russo and Joseph Russo.That's the most emotional superhero film, I have ever seen.The film itself begins with an emotional scene where Tony Stark (Iron Man) drifts into space without food or water and sends a suicide message to Pepper Potts when his oxygen supply starts to conclude. Meanwhile, the remaining Avengers - Thor, Black Widow, Captain America, and Bruce Banner - must find a way to reclaim their defeated allies for an epic showdown with Thanos - an evil demigod, who destroyed half the living things in the universe, with the stones of infinity, thereby causing a terrible genocide.Tony Stark is rescued by Captain Marvel and leads them to the other heroes. Tony Stark invents the time machine, thanks to which the Avengers can collect all six infinity stones and perform one of the successful finales of the 14 million right that Doctor Strange foresaw. And believe me, the ending will be full of emotions and will be remembered for the rest of your life, because for the Marvel movie universe it is only the beginning.The film is directed by the Rousseau brothers, under the direction of Marvel. Anthony Russo and Joseph Russo are American films and television directors. The brothers make most of their work together. They won «Emmy» for their work on the comedy series «Slow Development». The brothers themselves said in interviews, that they wanted to make a film that would be understandable to a new audience, that had not previously been interested in comics or Marvel movies. I'm into comic books and Marvel movies, but I can tell you that the brothers managed to make a movie that would be understandable to a new audience. The film very clearly shows the characters and explains the story. The thing that amazes me the most, is how the brothers managed to put together a story that consists of 24 comics. They worked very hard because the comics were written at different times, from 1998 to 2012.In my opinion, the most important factor in the film is Robert Downey Junior, who played an iron man. It's one of the main characters in the movie, but you have to see the movie to find out why. Robert Downey Jr. Has already appeared in Marvel films, such as ""Iron Man"". Also, I want to touch on what special effects are used in the film. I am very much as the space and abilities of the characters are transmitted to me. For example, beautifully depicted scenes, where Thanos uses the stones of infinity. In the film, the music is well-chosen, especially in touching scenes.In the end, I can say that the movie ""Avengers Finale"" is worth your time. Although the movie lasts 3 hours and 2 minutes, it is perfect for those who love fiction and adventure. Special for those who read Marvel comics."
2322,"Aug 9, 2019",6,Not enough Action to justify the final battle.. Really... being the End of an Era... lifetime movie... come on.. Infinity war has an 9 pointer from me but this endgame... I don't know... just a bit disappointing in the action department. No Thrill at all. I guess a few folks are right... Fan service Movie...
2323,"Aug 1, 2019",1,"If you like special effects then you will like this movie. If you like a good, intriguing, believable story with interesting characters then this movie may be very lacking in that department. The characters with all their interesting super powers just seemed to be a bore. Perhaps this sort of thing happens when you have too many main characters in one movie. There is no character development. One thing there is no shortage of is good looking special effects but it merely covers up the inadequacy of any kind of substance in the story lines and characters.The story totally contradicts itself. I'm not going to post spoilers in this review but in the end it really looked like the writers just made up unrealistic stuff that did not make any sense or had any sort of believable realism. If you tell a story like a 3 year old, other 3 year olds are going to love your story but adults are going to be bored to tears.They turned almighty Thor into a 3 year old, with mannerisms, intellect and all the traits 3 year olds display. But here we go again with Hollywood trying to emasculate men in all their latest block busters. Political nonsense that seems to be infecting and infesting big budget movies... It really just makes the world of Hollywood look all the more plastic.Perhaps the extremely high rating of this movie made me expect something really good and entertaining but all the enthusiasm I had soon turned in boredom and mild resentment because 3 hours is a lot to spend on something that seemed to bring only boredom."
2324,"Apr 28, 2019",10,"The story-telling is so powerful that you hardly find a minute in 3hr joyless.The movie is so well written and directed that no matter, which character you like the most, you would find a moment of ecstasy. (Though, one particular character should have given more importance I think. You will find out!)DO NOT watch the HD-cam print from torrents. It will be a big mistake not to watch this movie in 3D."
2325,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"NÃO HA ADJETIVO SUFICIENTE PARA ILUSTRAR AS EMOÇÕES QUE ESTE FILME PROPORCIONA. É IMPECAVEL, SENSACIONAL, PRIMOROSO... PQP, QUE FILMAO DA PORRA!ANTES DE ASSISTI-LO, COLOQUE SUAS EXPECTATIVAS NAS NUVENS, APÓS ASSISTI-LO VERÁ QUE SUAS EXPECTATIVAS FORAM JOGADAS AO ESPAÇO"
2326,"Apr 25, 2019",10,I highly recommend to watch this incredible superhero movie. It was amazing and had an incredible ending.
2327,"Apr 27, 2019",10,The best for the last movie of this first 22 movies of the UCM ... THANKS MARVEL
2328,"Jun 30, 2019",10,"Incredible movie, abseloutly phenomenal second part of Infinity War. It isnt a happy ending like other movies. Just a wow movie"
2329,"Sep 20, 2020",6,"Endgame was definitely better than infinity war. Luckily they did not make the mistake of staring all marvel heroes on every planet and in space (or at least not for the main part). This film was literally about cleaning up the huge mess infinity war left behind. Better, but far from the great first 2 parts of this series. A very slow pace, overly long, far fetched story full of plot holes. Some nice elements though like the ""back to the future"" part. And as expected there was the obligatory tear jerking part at the end."
2330,"Apr 25, 2019",10,This was an EPIC and FUNNY movie! The ending was so cool and emotional.
2331,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"Left me shocked despite the theories building up to the film. I'm mentally exhausted from watching it but my god, they definitely end on a high! I couldn't have asked for a better ending."
2332,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Loved it! Made me tear up many, many times. The cast did amazing!"
2333,"Jul 23, 2022",9,"Come on, it's one of the best comic book films of all time. Fun, funny, and emotional. I'm not even going to spend time reviewing it really. I'm in the midst of rewatching the MCU and one thing I will say is this: Robert Downey Jr. Is a gem. At this point he could've really phoned it in and few of us would've noticed or cared but he gives everything he's got in this performance. He's the best actor in the MCU."
2334,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Don't want to give any spoilers, but let's just saw the theater was full of laughter, tension, and applause basically the whole way through. Amazing!!"
2335,"Apr 27, 2019",1,"The film was ok, but i don't see Marvel in it. I see frustrations, unanswered questions, heroes ""unavailable"" and heroes ""unused"". I enjoyed it, but i went in with too many expectations. And in the end i can only say: ""Plot holes ftw"""
2336,"Dec 8, 2024",10,"Avengers: Endgame (2019) is a cinematic triumph that delivers a powerful conclusion to over a decade of Marvel storytelling. The film masterfully balances epic action with heartfelt moments, creating an emotional rollercoaster for fans. From jaw-dropping battles to quiet, character-driven scenes, every moment feels earned and impactful.The cast shines, bringing depth and closure to their beloved characters, while the visual effects and score amplify the spectacle. It's a love letter to fans, packed with callbacks and surprises that reward years of investment. Whether you laugh, cry, or cheer, Endgame is an unforgettable experience and a landmark in superhero cinema."
2337,"May 6, 2019",8,"A satisfying ending to a saga that has been going on for 11 years... not a cinematic masterpiece by any means, But fulfilled my comic book-nerdy needs. 9/10. It's good and you should see this movie. Dialogue: The writing isn't great but has it ever been in these films? (Ok Logan had a pretty good script) Acting: Maybe it's just me because I've asked 3 of my friends what they thought and they said the expected better... but I thought Downey was amazing in this CGI: Great Directing: a pretty Good job by the Russo Brothers"
2338,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Best super heroes film evaa thank you marvel !! great moviee
2339,"Apr 26, 2019",8,"I won't add any spoilers. It was a great marvel movie, but not one of my favorites. They had so much information to try and wrap into three hours, that they just left gapping plot holes. 2nd half of the movie rocked, but still massive plot holes."
2340,"Apr 26, 2019",7,"As the title states. The climax of this film is the most important part. Something the whole previous 2 and a half hours builds up to. To have it spoiled by an all powerful character, who can just swoop in and destroy whole spaceships, takes away all the suspense and hence, in my opinion, all the fun.There is a reason even superheroes are flawed. Even they struggle and fail. It's to allow us to identify with them.I loved Infinity War, but this I will not see again."
2341,"May 4, 2019",10,I've never written a review on IMDB before. Im writing this today to describe how incredible of a viewing experience this movie truly is. Your life cannot be fully lived if you have not watched this movie. It is the greatest cinematic masterpiece in regards to bringing closure to a series I have ever witnessed. I'm glad to have lived during the time this movie was created.
2342,"Apr 25, 2019",10,"So where to start?After 11 years of watching all MCU movies repeatedly (like countless times, you can ask my friends about it, talk about INFINITY watch 😅). I am more than happy that the Marvel Studios together with the Russo brothers and all of their crews brought this movie to life. How can you even fit all the stories together in just 3 hours of runtime? T'was a genius way of culminating NOT ONLY the phase 3 movies but even from phase 1.DON'T EXPECT TO UNDERSTAND EVERY PIECE OF THE STORY/MOVIE WITHOUT WATCHING THE LAST ONES!""Part of the journey is the end"", and this movie was the greatest ending of a saga that I've ever witnessed.11/10#AvengersEndgame"
2343,"May 2, 2019",10,"""Avengers: Endgame"" did the un-thinkable, it was a thrilling conclusion to 2018's ""Avengers: Infinity War"", and concluded the character arches to Marvel favorites, Iron Man, Captain America, and Black Widow. The M.C.U (Marvel Cinematic Universe) started in 2008 with Robert Downey Jr. starting in the title role of ""Iron Man"" and 22 films later and over a decade of time has changed both Hollywood and audience's expectations forever. The film directed by Joe and Anthony Russo tells an exciting and emotional story that also gives Marvel fans exactly what they would want with multiple fanboy/girl moments and Easter eggs throughout. The film works on so many levels, but the highlight is the emotional impact the concluding arches of these characters. With so many films for fans to get-to-know, and understand these characters, it almost feels like watching one's best friend or family member go through the on-screen drama that unfolds. This may not be the end of the M.C.U., but it is the end of a very special era for comic book and movie fans."
2344,"Nov 24, 2019",10,"To anyone who went to see Iron Man in theaters when it came out,, and then followed the continuing journey as each new film debuted,,, this movie was the PERFECT conclusion (to what we've seen so far).In Infinity War,, Thanos took all our hearts and ripped them to pieces! Well this one begins right after those events.Where to begin?!? I really can't say much w/o giving away spoilers,,, so if there's anyone out there who hasn't seen this masterpiece,,, WATCH IT ALREADY!!!"
2345,"Apr 27, 2019",10,A must watch Movie The movie was way more than i had expected.Enjoyed it a lot.
2346,"May 6, 2019",8,"I think the director didn't want to get a dizzy about time machine. It made some questions about the plot, for example: -When the ending war was happened? Years? Why past thanos can find the present avenger? -How can Capt America getting older?"
2347,"Oct 29, 2019",8,"This was eye spectacle with story line defining the secquence of actions. RDJ, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth roles were anchoring the story line perfectly. Few loops in the story which are not justfied. Overall an awesome comic book movie."
2348,"Jul 16, 2024",9,"End Game is a gripping thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The plot unfolds with masterful pacing, blending intense action sequences with poignant character development. The performances are stellar, particularly from the lead actors who bring depth and emotion to their roles. The cinematography adds to the suspense, capturing both the frenetic energy of the chase scenes and the quiet moments of reflection. While some plot twists may be predictable, the overall narrative is engaging and satisfying. The film's exploration of moral dilemmas and the consequences of choices adds a layer of complexity that elevates it above typical action fare. ""End Game"" is a must-watch for fans of the genre, offering thrills, suspense, and thought-provoking themes in equal measure."
2349,"Apr 27, 2019",10,Look it is the best movie I've ever saw in my life. Plz watch only in theatres.
2350,"Apr 26, 2019",6,"Started slow. Ignored some of the Marvel hero lore. Made some characters too strong and others too weak; this was incongruent with previous movies.The middle picked up and the end was engaging, but still not as good as the hype. Definitely not worthy of the opening day ratings."
2351,"Jul 5, 2020",6,"Never has so much been spent on glorious VFX to service an orgy of Deus Ex Machina in order to fulfill the standard juvenile Hollywood ending that the good guys always win. Such a pure, white bread, immature ending, I'm embarrassed for Marvel that so much effort went into an ending dumbed down for pre-teens. What's the point of all this comic-book-to-big-screen-madness if there's no doubt of the outcome?! I suppose they TRY to make it look difficult for the heroes but then you throw in never-done-before quantum-based time-travel and voila, good guys prevail. Such a colossal waste of story-telling, of sci-fi adventure. My soul weeps."
2352,"Nov 21, 2020",2,"While the visual effects were incredible and the memes coming out of this movie were entertaining, I don't think marvel really put too much work into this ending. I went into this movie interested in watching mcu movies and came out completely against them. Probably will never see an mcu movie again."
2353,"Apr 24, 2019",9,"Endgame was written to be the epic conclusion of 20-plus marvel movies. It is a good conclusion but not an 'epic' one. Every character is given a good arch and heartfelt moments. The movie just lacks the magic of Infinity War. There are very few fight scenes until the big fight at the end, and I just found myself getting impatient, waiting for something to happen. The plot was jumping around a lot and sometimes things just seemed to happen so quickly, which is weird when many scenes seemed to drag on. Nebula contributed heavily to the plot, but I don't think it made enough sense, and it also makes Nebula the most annoying character, as she already gave away the soul stones location in Infinity War. Everything about Hulk felt off, and Captain Marvel just didn't fit in. To be fair, there are some amazing moments in the final act, and I finally got the action I was craving. But by then, I had somewhat disconnected for the movie. What I loved about Infinity War is it starts with amazing momentum and never stops. Endgame took just a little too long to establish itself. Even once the Avengers start executing their plan, there is very little action or epic moments. I also think Thanos was underplayed in the movie, as were the use of the infinity stones or any superhero powers. The heroes definitely could've played around more with their settings as well. Maybe it will be better when watched in conjunction with Infinity War, and maybe I'm a little too much of a Thanos fan. All in all, it's a good watch but the movie failed to make me feel the emotions I felt from Infinity War."
2354,"Apr 25, 2019",9,"This is one of the most ambitious movies ever put to screen and boy does the ambition pay-off. I can see this movie pleasing both hardcore MCU fans and causal viewers however you at least need to see Infinity war before watching Endgame. The acting, visual effects and overall story were great and will have probably set the bar for all superhero films to come. The only place I could see problems with the film were with the tone and pacing but they were just minor issues that are more than likely to happen with a 3 hour film. This movie is definitely worth the watch and is sure to be an instant classic."
2355,"May 6, 2019",9,Without the credits. The movie is 2 hours and 40 mins. The movie is boring at the start. It has a slow build up. It gets good..
2356,"Apr 27, 2019",10,"It's easy to be jaded. So many great shows and movie series build up and up, only to end with a whimper, retroactively stripping the earlier material of much of its quality. They get you to care about the characters, they get you involved in the plot, only to pull a ridiculous left turn or lose their way entirely, hobbling off into oblivion.Marvel could have joined those ranks. In fact, it was hard to see how they wouldn't do that. With all they'd built up over a decade plus, if they didn't deliver a great finale, it would have cast a retroactive shadow. Thankfully, I'm happy to say, they delivered all they needed to and more, cementing what will become known as the ""Infinity Saga"" as a generation-defining cultural behemoth that my kids will show their kids just as I've shared Star Wars with my own.The movie is just over 3 hours, but it very much needs all of that time to tell the story it needs to tell. The scale of this thing is mind-boggling. So many huge actors. So many characters. It could have been a mess.Instead, it hits all its marks expertly. It is both genuinely funny and genuinely emotional. The action serves a purpose and can be followed. The characters follow unforced, natural arcs that don't feel contrived or predetermined.The movie focuses on Iron Man and Captain America above all, which is appropriate - they have been the divided (sometimes violently so) heart of the Avengers since at least Civil War, and their somewhat competing visions have shaped everything else. In the end, I left with an overwhelming sense that the story had gone exactly where it needed to go. It was fulfilling. I am in awe of the fact that they pulled this off."
2357,"Jan 14, 2022",10,"Avengers: Endgame is one of my favorite films, the main reason I like this film is the amazing acting of the cast, I also like the scene where the superheroes gather as one and learn to put aside differences to work together to fix the situation because of the enemies of the superheroes. Took half the life on earthHowever, this film also has its drawbacks where this film does not provide amazing visual effects for a large film scale."
2358,"May 1, 2019",8,"I liked the movie however I think they kinda made the pace really slow, the first Infinity had way more action.Either way It had an epic ending for our heroes and I think they did a great job with that."
2359,"Apr 28, 2019",6,"Think they've done the super hero thing to death and this one is no better or worse than any of the others, except it's a good 30 minutes too long. The CGI runs rampant as always, plot is ludicrous as they usually are with these things and if this truly is the final instalment it's come non too soon! A lot of young people love these kind of films of course and good luck to them, me, I'd prefer a good western!"
2360,"Apr 26, 2019",10,"Soooo. Just finished the movie and this will not contain any spoilers but I need to voice my heart to all Marvel lovers... 22 movies over 11 years and this one movie profoundly used all of them in the final conclusion. My heart is saddened by the end but so over joyed by the extreme care the Russo brothers took to preserve stan lees finally curtain call. This movie was the perfect mix of humor and emotion and I can tell you I have never cried so much in a movie ever... Being an iron man can it truly does end exactly where it begun!!! Phenomenal movie, true cinematic perfection and this movie will sweep come oscars time. But words cannot express my feelings! The end of an era and a movie that will top box office records for centuries to come!!! Thank you marvel, and thank you to the actors for giving the fans something to remember for a lifetime"
2361,"May 1, 2019",1,I hate to see iron man in this movie frankly because of his real life character.
2362,"Jul 6, 2019",10,"This is my favorite movie of all time. I it love, i watched it 3 times in the cinema. Best movie ever."
2363,"Apr 26, 2019",10,Been a marvel fan all through eleven years. Watched every single movie on the opening day. It has The perfect ending. You would leave the theaters with a heavy heart for sure but with content that you've witnessed something truly amazing. I ve gone with a high expectation of course but they crossed it. You can't have asked for more. It's a gift from marvel to us fans. If only the tickets were available I would ve definitely gone for the next show as well. You're gonna experience each character. Thank you Marvel.
2364,"Apr 25, 2019",8,"Perhaps it's because Inifnity War has gathered all heroes before and linked their stories before so it doesn't feel THAT exciting anymore. Yet, it's an amazing piece of art that represents the perfect bow for Marvel's MCU"
